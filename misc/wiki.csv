interactive animation of the structure of atp adenosine triphosphate be an organic compound that provide energy to drive many process in living cell muscle contraction nerve impulse propagation and chemical synthesis find in all form of life atp be often refer to a the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer when consume in metabolic process it convert either to adenosine diphosphate adp or to adenosine monophosphate amp other process regenerate atp so that the human body recycle it own body weight equivalent in atp each day it be also a precursor to dna and rna and be use a a coenzyme from the perspective of biochemistry atp be classify a a nucleoside triphosphate which indicate that it consist of three component a nitrogenous base adenine the sugar ribose and the triphosphate in term of it structure atp consist of an adenine attach by the atom to the carbon atom of a sugar ribose which in turn be attach at the carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group in it many reaction relate to metabolism the adenine and sugar group remain unchanged but the triphosphate be convert to and monophosphate give respectively the derivative adp and amp the three phosphoryl group be refer to a the alpha α beta β and for the terminal phosphate gamma γ in neutral solution ionize atp exists mostly a with a small proportion of of metal cation to be polyanionic and feature a potentially chelatable polyphosphate group atp bind metal cation with high affinity the binding constant for be the binding of a divalent cation almost always magnesium strongly affect the interaction of atp with various protein due to the strength of the interaction atp exist in the cell mostly a a complex with bond to the phosphate oxygen center a second magnesium ion be critical for atp binding in the kinase domain the presence of regulates kinase activity salt of atp can be isolate a colorless solid the cycle of synthesis and degradation of atp and represent input and output of energy respectively atp be stable in aqueous solution between ph and in the absence of catalyst at more extreme ph it rapidly hydrolyse to adp and phosphate living cell maintain the ratio of atp to adp at a point ten order of magnitude from equilibrium with atp concentration fivefold high than the concentration of adp in the context of biochemical reaction the bond be frequently refer to a bond the hydrolysis of atp into adp and inorganic phosphate release of enthalpy with a change in free energy of the energy release by cleave either a phosphate pi or pyrophosphate ppi unit from atp at standard state of m be atp adp pi δ g atp amp ppi δ g these abbreviated equation can be write more explicitly r adenosyl o o o o o this image show a rotation of a single chelate with a charge of the anion be optimize at the d p theoretical level and the atomic connectivity modify by the human optimizer to reflect the probable electronic structure aerobic a typical intracellular concentration of atp be hard to pin down however report have show there to be μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes the dephosphorylation of atp and rephosphorylation of adp and amp occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism atp can be produce by a number of distinct cellular process the three main pathway in eukaryote be glycolysis the citric acid phosphorylation and the overall process of oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide the combination of pathway and be know a cellular respiration produce about equivalent of atp from each molecule of glucose atp production by a aerobic eukaryote occur mainly in the mitochondrion which comprise nearly of the volume of a typical cell in glycolysis glucose and glycerol be metabolize to pyruvate glycolysis generates two equivalent of atp through substrate phosphorylation catalyze by two enzyme pgk and pyruvate kinase two equivalent of nadh be also produce which can be oxidize via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional atp by atp synthase the pyruvate generate a an of glycolysis be a substrate for the krebs cycle glycolysis be view a consist of two phase with five step each phase the preparatory phase glucose be convert to one atp be invest in the step and another atp be invest in step step and of glycolysis be refer to a prim step in phase two equivalent of be convert to two pyruvates in step two atp be produce in addition in step two further equivalent of atp be produce in step and atp be generate from adp a net of two atp be form in the glycolysis cycle the glycolysis pathway be later associate with the citric acid cycle which produce additional equivalent of atp in glycolysis hexokinase be directly inhibit by it product and pyruvate kinase be inhibit by atp itself the main control point for the glycolytic pathway be phosphofructokinase pfk which be allosterically inhibit by high concentration of atp and activate by high concentration of amp the inhibition of pfk by atp be unusual since atp be also a substrate in the reaction catalyze by pfk the active form of the enzyme be a tetramer that exist in two conformation only one of which bind the second substrate the protein have two binding site for atp the active site be accessible in either protein conformation but atp binding to the inhibitor site stabilize the conformation that bind poorly a number of other small molecule can compensate for the shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate pfk include cyclic amp ammonium ion inorganic phosphate and and acid in the mitochondrion pyruvate be oxidize by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group which be fully oxidize to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle also know a the krebs cycle every turn of the citric acid cycle produce two molecule of carbon dioxide one equivalent of atp guanosine triphosphate gtp through phosphorylation catalyze by synthetase a coa be convert to succinate three equivalent of nadh and one equivalent of nadh and be recycle to and fad respectively generate additional atp by oxidative phosphorylation the oxidation of nadh result in the synthesis of equivalent of atp and the oxidation of one yield between equivalent of atp the majority of cellular atp be generate by this process although the citric acid cycle itself do not involve molecular oxygen it be an obligately aerobic process because be use to recycle the nadh and and provide the chemical energy drive the process in the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle cease the generation of atp by the mitochondrion from cytosolic nadh relies on the shuttle and to a less extent the shuttle because the inner mitochondrial membrane be impermeable to nadh and instead of transfer the generate nadh a malate dehydrogenase enzyme convert oxaloacetate to malate which be translocate to the mitochondrial matrix another malate reaction occur in the opposite direction produce oxaloacetate and nadh from the newly transport malate and the mitochondrion interior store of a transaminase convert the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space in oxidative phosphorylation the passage of electron from nadh and through the electron transport chain release the chemical energy of to pump proton out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space this pumping generate a proton motive force that be the net effect of a ph gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane flow of proton down this potential gradient that be from the intermembrane space to the matrix yield atp by atp synthase three atp be produce per turn although oxygen consumption appear fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force in the event of oxygen shortage hypoxia intracellular acidosis mediate by enhanced glycolytic rate and atp hydrolysis contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drive atp most of the atp synthesize in the mitochondrion will be use for cellular process in the cytosol thus it must be export from it site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix atp outward movement be favor by the membrane electrochemical potential because the cytosol have a relatively positive charge compare to the relatively negative matrix for every atp transport out it cost produce one atp cost about therefore make and export one atp require the inner membrane contain an antiporter the translocase which be an integral membrane protein use to exchange newly synthesize atp in the matrix for adp in the intermembrane space this translocase be drive by the membrane potential a it result in the movement of about negative charge out across the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for negative charge move inside however it be also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion the phosphate carrier move a proton in with each phosphate partially dissipate the proton gradient after complete glycolysis the citric acid cycle the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation approximately atp molecule be produce per glucose the citric acid cycle be regulate mainly by the availability of key substrate particularly the ratio of to nadh and the concentration of calcium inorganic phosphate atp adp and amp citrate the ion that give it name to the cycle be a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits pfk provide a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis in the presence of air and various cofactor and enzyme fatty acid be convert to the pathway be call each cycle of shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atom and produce one equivalent each of nadh and the be metabolize by the citric acid cycle to generate atp while the nadh and be use by oxidative phosphorylation to generate atp dozen of atp equivalent be generate by the of a single long acyl chain in oxidative phosphorylation the key control point be the reaction catalyze by cytochrome c oxidase which be regulate by the availability of it substrate the reduced form of cytochrome the amount of reduced cytochrome c available be directly relate to the amount of other substrate which directly imply this equation thus a high ratio of nadh to or a high ratio of adppi to atp imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity an additional level of regulation be introduce by the transport rate of atp and nadh between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm ketone body can be use a fuel yield atp and gtp molecule per acetoacetate molecule when oxidize in the mitochondrion ketone body be transport from the liver to other tissue where acetoacetate and beta can be reconvert to to produce reduce equivalent nadh and via the citric acid cycle ketone body can not be use a fuel by the liver because the liver lack the enzyme transferase also call thiophorase acetoacetate in low concentration be take up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which end with lactate acetoacetate in high concentration be absorb by cell other than those in the liver and enter a different pathway via though the pathway follow a different series of step require atp can be turn into pyruvate anaerobic fermentation be the metabolism of organic compound in the absence of air it involve phosphorylation in the absence of a respiratory electron transport chain the equation for the oxidation of glucose to lactic acid be atp anaerobic respiration be respiration in the absence of prokaryote can utilize a variety of electron acceptor these include nitrate sulfate and carbon dioxide replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate atp can also be synthesize through several replenishment reaction catalyze by the enzyme family of nucleoside diphosphate kinase ndks which use other nucleoside triphosphates a a phosphate donor and the atp family production during in plant atp be synthesize in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast the process be call photophosphorylation the machinery be similar to that in mitochondrion except that light energy be use to pump proton across a membrane to produce a force atp synthase then ensue exactly a in oxidative phosphorylation some of the atp produce in the chloroplast be consume in the calvin cycle which produce triose sugar the total quantity of atp in the human body be about mole the majority of atp be recycle from adp by the aforementioned process thus at any give time the total amount of atp adp remain fairly constant the energy use by human cell in an adult require the hydrolysis of to mole of atp daily which be around to kg a human will typically use up his or her body weight of atp over the course of the day each equivalent of atp be recycled time during a single day an example of the rossmann fold a structural domain of a decarboxylase enzyme from the bacterium staphylococcus epidermidis with a bound flavin mononucleotide cofactor atp be involve in signal transduction by serve a substrate for kinase enzyme that transfer phosphate group kinase be the most common protein they share a small number of common fold phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such a the protein kinase cascade atp be also a substrate of adenylate cyclase most commonly in g receptor signal transduction pathway and be transform to second messenger cyclic amp which be involve in trigger calcium signal by the release of calcium from intracellular store this form of signal transduction be particularly important in brain function although it be involve in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular process and rna atp be one of four monomer require in the synthesis of rna the process be promote by rna polymerase a similar process occur in the formation of dna except that atp be first convert to the deoxyribonucleotide datp like many condensation reaction in nature dna replication and dna transcription also consume atp acid activation in protein synthetase enzyme consume atp in the attachment trna to amino acid form complex aminoacyl transferase bind acid to trna the couple reaction proceeds in two step aa atp ppi trna amp the amino acid be couple to the penultimate nucleotide at the of the trna the a in the sequence cca via an ester bond roll over in illustration bind cassette transport chemical out of a cell against a gradient be often associate with atp hydrolysis transport be mediate by atp bind cassette transporter the human genome encodes abc transporter that be use for export drug lipid and other compound signal and cell secrete atp to communicate with other cell in a process call purinergic signal atp serf a a neurotransmitter in many part of the nervous system modulate ciliary beating affect vascular oxygen supply etc atp be either secrete directly across the cell membrane through channel protein or be pump into vesicle which then fuse with the membrane cell detect atp use the purinergic receptor protein and protein solubility atp have recently be propose to act a a biological hydrotrope and have be show to affect solubility biochemistry laboratory often use in vitro study to explore molecular process atp analog be also use in crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with atp often together with other substrate enzyme inhibitor of enzyme such a kinase be need to examine the binding site and transition state involve in reaction most useful atp analog can not be hydrolyze a atp would be instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely relate to the state adenosine be an extremely common atp analog in which one of the oxygen be replace by a sulfur atom this anion be hydrolyze at a dramatically slow rate than atp itself and function a an inhibitor of process in crystallographic study hydrolysis transition state be model by the bound vanadate ion caution be warrant in interpret the result of experiment use atp analog since some enzyme can hydrolyze them at appreciable rate at high concentration atp be discover in by karl lohmann and jendrassik and independently by cyrus fiske and yellapragada subba rao of harvard medical school both team compete against each other to find an assay for phosphorus it be propose to be the intermediary between and reaction in cell by fritz albert lipmann in it be first

apoptosis begin when the nucleus of the cell begin to shrink after the shrink the plasma membrane bleb and fold around different organelle the bleb continue to form and the organelle fragment and move away from one another apoptosis from ancient greek ἀπόπτωσις apóptōsis fall off be a form of programmed cell death that occur in multicellular organism biochemical event lead to characteristic cell change morphology and death these change include blebbing cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation chromosomal dna fragmentation and global mrna decay the average adult human lose between and billion cell each day due to apoptosis for an average human child between the age of and approximately billion cell die per day in contrast to necrosis which be a form of traumatic cell death that result from acute cellular injury apoptosis be a highly regulate and control process that confers advantage during an organism life cycle for example the separation of finger and toe in a developing human embryo occur because cell between the digit undergo apoptosis unlike necrosis apoptosis produce cell fragment call apoptotic body that phagocytic cell be able to engulf and remove before the content of the cell can spill out onto surround cell and cause damage to them because apoptosis can not stop once it have begin it be a highly regulated process apoptosis can be initiate through one of two pathway in the intrinsic pathway the cell kill itself because it sense cell stress while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kill itself because of signal from other cell weak external signal may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis both pathway induce cell death by activate caspase which be protease or enzyme that degrade proteins the two pathway both activate initiator caspase which then activate executioner caspase which then kill the cell by degrade protein indiscriminately research on apoptosis have increase substantially since the early in addition to it importance a a biological phenomenon defective apoptotic process have be implicate in a wide variety of disease excessive apoptosis cause atrophy whereas an insufficient amount result in uncontrolled cell proliferation such a cancer some factor like fas receptor and caspase promote apoptosis while some member of the family of protein inhibit apoptosis german scientist karl vogt be first to describe the principle of apoptosis in in anatomist walther flemming deliver a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death however it be not until that the topic be resurrect while study tissue use electron microscopy john foxton ross kerr at the university of queensland be able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death follow the publication of a paper describe the phenomenon kerr be invite to join alastair currie as well a andrew wyllie who be currie graduate student at university of aberdeen in the trio publish a seminal article in the british journal of cancer kerr have initially use the term program cell necrosis but in the article the process of natural cell death be call apoptosis kerr wyllie and currie credit james cormack a professor of greek language at university of aberdeen with suggest the term apoptosis kerr receive the paul ehrlich and ludwig darmstaedter prize on march for his description of apoptosis he share the prize with boston biologist robert horvitz for many year neither apoptosis nor programmed cell death be a highly cited term two discovery bring cell death from obscurity to a major field of research identification of component of the cell death control and effector mechanism and linkage of abnormality in cell death to human disease in particular cancer the nobel prize in medicine be award to sydney brenner horvitz and john sulston for their work identify gene that control apoptosis the gene be identify by study in the nematode c elegans and homologues of these gene function in human to regulate apoptosis john sulston win the nobel prize in medicine in for his pioneer research on apoptosis in greek apoptosis translates to the fall off of leaf from a tree cormack professor of greek language reintroduce the term for medical use a it have a medical meaning for the greek over two thousand year before hippocrates use the term to mean the fall off of the bone galen extend it meaning to the dropping of the scabs cormack be no doubt aware of this usage when he suggest the name debate continue over the correct pronunciation with opinion divide between a pronunciation with the second p silent and the second p pronounce a in the original greek in english the p of the greek consonant cluster be typically silent at the beginning of a word pterodactyl ptolemy but articulate when use in combine form precede by a vowel a in helicopter or the order of insect diptera lepidoptera etc in the original kerr wyllie currie paper there be a footnote regard the pronunciation we be most grateful to professor james cormack of the department of greek university of aberdeen for suggest this term the word apoptosis be use in greek to describe the drop off or fall off of petal from flower or leaf from tree to show the derivation clearly we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable the second half of the word be pronounce like ptosis with the p silent which come from the same root to fall and be already use to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid right control of the apoptotic mechanism the initiation of apoptosis be tightly regulate by activation mechanism because once apoptosis have begin it inevitably lead to the death of the cell the two activation mechanism be the intrinsic pathway also call the mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic pathway the intrinsic pathway be activate by intracellular signal generate when cell be stress and depend on the release of protein from the intermembrane space of mitochondrion the extrinsic pathway be activate by extracellular ligand bind to death receptor which lead to the formation of the signal complex disc a cell initiate intracellular apoptotic signal in response to a stress which may bring about cell suicide the binding of nuclear receptor by glucocorticoid heat radiation nutrient deprivation viral infection hypoxia increase intracellular concentration of free fatty acid and increase intracellular calcium concentration for example by damage to the membrane can all trigger the release of intracellular apoptotic signal by a damage cell a number of cellular component such a poly adp ribose polymerase may also help regulate apoptosis single cell fluctuation have be observe in experimental study of stress induce apoptosis before the actual process of cell death be precipitate by enzyme apoptotic signal must cause regulatory protein to initiate the apoptosis pathway this step allow those signal to cause cell death or the process to be stop should the cell no longer need to die several protein be involve but two main method of regulation have be identify the targeting of mitochondrion functionality or directly transduce the signal via adaptor protein to the apoptotic mechanism an extrinsic pathway for initiation identify in several toxin study be an increase in calcium concentration within a cell cause by drug activity which also can cause apoptosis via a calcium bind protease calpain the mitochondrion be essential to multicellular life without them a cell cease to respire aerobically and quickly die this fact form the basis for some apoptotic pathway apoptotic protein that target mitochondrion affect them in different way they may cause mitochondrial swell through the formation of membrane pore or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effector to leak out they be very closely relate to intrinsic pathway and tumor arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity there be also a grow body of evidence indicate that nitric oxide be able to induce apoptosis by help to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondrion and therefore make it more permeable nitric oxide have be implicate in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through it possible action a a signal molecule of subsequent pathway that activate apoptosis during apoptosis cytochrome c be release from mitochondrion through the action of the protein bax and bak the mechanism of this release be enigmatic but appear to stem from a multitude of and of insert into the outer membrane once cytochrome c be release it bind with apoptotic protease activate factor and atp which then bind to to create a protein complex know a an apoptosome the apoptosome cleave the to it active form of which in turn cleaves and activate into the effector mitochondrion also release protein know a smacs second activator of caspase into the cell cytosol follow the increase in permeability of the mitochondrion membrane smac bind to protein that inhibit apoptosis iaps thereby deactivate them and prevent the iaps from arrest the process and therefore allow apoptosis to proceed iap also normally suppress the activity of a group of cysteine protease call caspase which carry out the degradation of the cell therefore the actual degradation enzyme can be see to be indirectly regulate by mitochondrial permeability overview of signal transduction pathway two theory of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanism in mammal have be suggest the tumor necrosis factor model and the model both involve receptor of the tnf receptor tnfr family couple to extrinsic signal be a cytokine produce mainly by activate macrophage and be the major extrinsic mediator of apoptosis most cell in the human body have two receptor for and the binding of to have be show to initiate the pathway that lead to caspase activation via the intermediate membrane protein tnf death domain tradd and death domain protein fadd can inhibit signaling by bind to flip inhibits the activation of binding of this receptor can also indirectly lead to the activation of transcription factor involve in cell survival and inflammatory response however signal through might also induce apoptosis in a manner the link between and apoptosis show why an abnormal production of play a fundamental role in several human disease especially in autoimmune disease the receptor superfamily also include death receptor drs such a and these receptor bind to the proteintrail and mediate apoptosis apoptosis be know to be one of the primary mechanism of targeted cancer therapy luminescent iridium hybrid iphs have recently be design which mimic trail and bind to death receptor on cancer cell thereby induce their apoptosis fas path the fa receptor first apoptosis signal also know a or be a transmembrane protein of the tnf family which bind the fas ligand fasl the interaction between fa and fasl result in the formation of the signal complex disc which contain the fadd and in some type of cell type i process directly activate other member of the caspase family and trigger the execution of apoptosis of the cell in other type of cell type ii the fa start a feedback loop that spiral into increase release of proapoptotic factor from mitochondrion and the amplified activation of common component follow and fas activation in mammalian cell a balance between proapoptotic bax bid bak or bad and and member of the family be establish this balance be the proportion of proapoptotic homodimers that form in the of the mitochondrion the proapoptotic homodimers be require to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable for the release of caspase activator such a cytochrome c and smac control of proapoptotic protein under normal cell condition of nonapoptotic cell be incompletely understood but in general bax or bak be activate by the activation of protein part of the family caspases caspase play the central role in the transduction of er apoptotic signal caspase be protein that be highly conserved protease there be two type of caspase initiator caspase caspase and effector caspase caspase the activation of initiator caspase require bind to specific oligomeric activator protein effector caspase be then activate by these active initiator caspase through proteolytic cleavage the active effector caspase then proteolytically degrade a host of intracellular protein to carry out the cell death program apoptotic pathway there also exist a apoptotic pathway that be mediate by aif factor model in amphibian frog xenopus laevis serf a an ideal model system for the study of the mechanism of apoptosis in fact iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cell of the larval gill tail and fin in amphibian metamorphosis and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transform the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathway help tumor to evade cell death and develop drug resistance many family of protein act a negative regulator categorize into either antiapoptotic factor such a iaps and protein or prosurvival factor like cflip fadd akt and many pathway and signal lead to apoptosis but these converge on a single mechanism that actually cause the death of the cell after a cell receive stimulus it undergo organize degradation of cellular organelle by activated proteolytic caspase in addition to the destruction of cellular organelle mrna be rapidly and globally degrade by a mechanism that be not yet fully characterize mrna decay be trigger very early in apoptosis a cell undergo apoptosis show a series of characteristic morphological change early alteration include cell shrinkage and round occur because of the retraction lamellipodia and the breakdown of the proteinaceous cytoskeleton by caspases the cytoplasm appear dense and the organelle appear tightly pack chromatin undergoes condensation into compact patch against the nuclear envelope also know a the perinuclear envelope in a process know a pyknosis a hallmark of apoptosis the nuclear envelope become discontinuous and the dna inside it be fragment in a process refer to a karyorrhexis the nucleus break into several discrete chromatin body or nucleosomal unit due to the degradation of dna apoptosis progress quickly and it product be quickly remove make it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology section during karyorrhexis endonuclease activation leave short dna fragment regularly space in size these give a characteristic laddered appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis test for dna ladder differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death cell different step in apoptotic cell disassembly before the apoptotic cell be dispose of there be a process of disassembly there be three recognize step in apoptotic cell disassembly membrane blebbing the cell membrane show irregular bud know a bleb initially these be small surface bleb later these can grow into large dynamic membrane blebs an important regulator of apoptotic cell membrane blebbing be rho associate protein kinase formation of membrane protrusion some cell type under specific condition may develop different type of long thin extension of the cell membrane call membrane protrusion three type have be describe microtubule spike foot of death and apoptopodia the latter have a appearance pannexin be an important component of membrane channel involve in the formation of apoptopodia and bead apoptopodia fragmentation the cell break apart into multiple vesicle call apoptotic body which undergo phagocytosis the plasma membrane protrusion may help bring apoptotic body closer to phagocyte of dead the removal of dead cell by neighbor phagocytic cell have be term efferocytosis die cell that undergo the final stage of apoptosis display phagocytotic molecule such a phosphatidylserine on their cell surface phosphatidylserine be normally find on the inner leaflet surface of the plasma membrane but be redistribute during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a protein know a scramblase these molecule mark the cell for phagocytosis by cell possess the appropriate receptor such a macrophage the removal of die cell by phagocyte occurs in an orderly manner without elicit an inflammatory response during apoptosis cellular rna and dna be separate from each other and sort to different apoptotic body separation of rna be initiate a nucleolar segregation many have be make in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the protein several caspase in addition to and fadd have be mutate to determine the new phenotype in order to create a tumor necrosis factor tnf knockout an exon contain the nucleotide be remove from the gene this exon encode a portion of the mature tnf domain as well a the leader sequence which be a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing mouse develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormality however upon immunization with srbc sheep red blood cell these mouse demonstrate a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response they be able to generate normal level of igm but could not develop specific igg level be the protein that turn on caspase by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that lead to apoptosis since a mutation in the gene be embryonic lethal a gene trap strategy be use in order to generate an mouse this assay be use to disrupt gene function by create an intragenic gene fusion when an gene trap be introduce into cell many morphological change occur such a spina bifida the persistence of interdigital web and open brain in addition after embryonic day the brain of the embryo show several structural change cell be protect from apoptosis stimulus such a irradiation a mouse exhibit normal forebrain formation and a decrease programmed cell death in some neuronal population and in the spinal cord lead to an increase in motor neuron the caspase protein be integral part of the apoptosis pathway so it follow that make have vary damaging result a caspase lead to a severe brain malformation a caspase lead to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality however with the use of technology a caspase have be create that exhibit an increase in peripheral t cell an impaired t cell response and a defect in neural tube closure these mouse be find to be resistant to apoptosis mediate by tnfr etc but not resistant to apoptosis cause by uv irradiation chemotherapeutic drug and other stimulus finally a caspase be characterize by ectopic cell mass in the brain and abnormal apoptotic feature such a membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation a remarkable feature of these ko mouse be that they have a very restricted phenotype ko mouse have deformation of neural tissue and fadd and casp ko show defective heart development however in both type of ko other organ develop normally and some cell type be still sensitive to apoptotic stimulus suggest that unknown proapoptotic pathway exist in order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic necroptotic cell one can do analysis of morphology by microscopy flow fluorocytometry and transmission electron microscopy there be also various biochemical technique for analysis of cell surface marker phosphatidylserine exposure versus cell permeability by flow cytometry cellular marker such a dna fragmentation flow cytometry caspase activation bid cleavage and cytochrome c release western blot it be important to know how primary and secondary necrotic cell can be distinguish by analysis of supernatant for caspase and release of cytokeratin however no distinct surface or biochemical marker of necrotic cell death have be identify yet and only negative marker be available these include absence of apoptotic marker caspase activation cytochrome c release and oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation and differential kinetics of cell death marker phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization a selection of technique that can be use to distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cell could be find in these reference a section of mouse liver show several apoptotic cell indicate by arrow stain to show cell undergoing apoptosis orange neonatal cardiomyocytes ultrastructure after the many different type of apoptotic pathway contain a multitude of different biochemical component many of them not yet understand a a pathway be more or less sequential in nature removing or modify one component lead to an effect in another in a living organism this can have disastrous effect often in the form of disease or disorder a discussion of every disease cause by modification of the various apoptotic pathway would be impractical but the concept overlie each one be the same the normal functioning of the pathway have be disrupt in such a way a to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis this result in a cell that live past it date and be able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to it progeny increase the likelihood of the cell become cancerous or diseased a recently describe example of this concept in action can be see in the development of a lung cancer call the inhibitor of apoptosis protein xiap be overexpressed in cell of the cell line xiaps bind to the processed form of and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c therefore overexpression lead to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonist a a consequence the balance of and proapoptotic effector be upset in favour of the former and the damage cell continue to replicate despite be direct to die defect in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cell occur often at the level of control of transcription factor a a particular example defect in molecule that control transcription factor in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signal to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belong this degree of independence from external survival signal can enable cancer metastasis of the protein accumulate when dna be damage due to a chain of biochemical factor part of this pathway include and which induce transcription of the gene result in the increase of protein level and enhancement of cancer prevent the cell from replicate by stop the cell cycle at or interphase to give the cell time to repair however it will induce apoptosis if damage be extensive and repair effort fail any disruption to the regulation of the or interferon gene will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumor inhibition of apoptosis can result in a number of cancer autoimmune disease inflammatory disease and viral infection it be originally believe that the associated accumulation of cell be due to an increase in cellular proliferation but it be now know that it be also due to a decrease in cell death the most common of these disease be cancer the disease of excessive cellular proliferation which be often characterize by an overexpression of iap family member a a result the malignant cell experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction gene such a ra or be mutate or inactivate in diseased cell and further gene such a also modify their expression in tumor some apoptotic factor be vital during mitochondrial respiration cytochrome pathological inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cell be correlate with frequent respiratory metabolic shift toward glycolysis an observation know a the apoptosis in hela cell be inhibit by protein produce by the cell these inhibitory protein target retinoblastoma protein these protein regulate the cell cycle but be render inactive when bound to an inhibitory protein hpv and be inhibitory protein express by the human papillomavirus hpv be responsible for the formation of the cervical tumor from which hela cell be derive hpv cause which regulate the cell cycle to become inactive hpv bind to retinoblastoma tumor suppress protein and limit it ability to control cell division these two inhibitory protein be partially responsible for hela cell immortality by inhibit apoptosis to occur cdv canine distemper virus be able to induce apoptosis despite the presence of these inhibitory protein this be an important oncolytic property of cdv this virus be capable of kill canine lymphoma cell oncoproteins and still leave inactive but they be not able to avoid the activation of caspase induce from the stress of viral infection these oncolytic property provide a promising link between cdv and lymphoma apoptosis which can lead to development of alternative treatment method for both canine lymphoma and human lymphoma defect in the cell cycle be think to be responsible for the resistance to chemotherapy or radiation by certain tumor cell so a virus that can induce apoptosis despite defect in the cell cycle be useful for cancer treatment the main method of treatment for potential death from diseases involves either increase or decrease the susceptibility of apoptosis in diseased cell depend on whether the disease be cause by either the inhibition of or excess apoptosis for instance treatment aim to restore apoptosis to treat disease with deficient cell death and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat disease involve with excessive cell death to stimulate apoptosis one can increase the number of death receptor ligands such a tnf or trail antagonize the pathway or introduce smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor iaps the addition of agent such a herceptin iressa or gleevec work to stop cell from cycling and cause apoptosis activation by block growth and survival signal further upstream finally add complex displaces and activate the pathway lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis many different method can be use either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various place along the death signal pathway apoptosis be a programme that be inherent in every cell of the body in cancer the apoptosis ratio be altered cancer treatment by chemotherapy and irradiation kill target cell primarily by induce apoptosis on the other hand loss of control of cell death result in excess apoptosis can lead to neurodegenerative disease hematologic disease and tissue damage it be of interest to note that neuron that rely on mitochondrial respiration undergo apoptosis in neurodegenerative disease such a alzheimer and parkinson an observation know a the warburg moreover there be an inverse epidemiological comorbidity between neurodegenerative disease and cancer the progression of hiv be directly link to excess unregulated apoptosis in a healthy individual the number of lymphocyte be in balance with the cell generate by the bone marrow however in patient this balance be lose due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate cell in the case of hiv lymphocyte die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis when stimulate at the molecular level hyperactive apoptosis can be cause by defect in signal pathway that regulate the family proteins increased expression of apoptotic protein such a bim or their decreased proteolysis lead to cell death and can cause a number of pathology depend on the cell where excessive activity of bim occur cancer cell can escape apoptosis through mechanism that suppress bim expression or by increased proteolysis of bim treatment aim to inhibit work to block specific caspase finally the akt protein kinase promote cell survival through two pathway akt phosphorylates and inhibits bad a family member cause bad to interact with the scaffold result in bcl dissociation and thus cell survival akt also activate ikkα which lead to activation and cell survival active induces the expression of gene such a result in inhibition of apoptosis have be find to play both an antiapoptotic role and a proapoptotic role depend on the stimulus utilized and the cell type the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus infection into aid be due primarily to the depletion of lymphocyte in a manner that be too rapid for the body bone marrow to replenish the cell lead to a compromise immune system one of the mechanism by which cell be deplete be apoptosis which result from a series of biochemical pathway hiv enzymes deactivate this do not directly cause cell death but prim the cell for apoptosis should the appropriate signal be receive in parallel these enzyme activate proapoptotic which do directly activate the mitochondrial event of apoptosis hiv may increase the level of cellular protein that prompt apoptosis hiv proteins decrease the amount of glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane release viral particle and protein present in extracellular fluid be able to induce apoptosis in nearby bystander t helper cell hiv decrease the production of molecule involve in mark the cell for apoptosis give the virus time to replicate and continue release apoptotic agent and virion into the surround tissue the infect cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic t cell cell may also die a direct consequence of viral infection expression induces tubular cell arrest and apoptosis the progression from hiv to aid be not immediate or even necessarily rapid hiv cytotoxic activity toward lymphocyte be classify a aid once a give patient cell count fall below researcher from kumamoto university in japan have develop a new method to eradicate hiv in viral reservoir cell name and apoptosis use the synthesize compound heptanoylphosphatidyl pentakisphophate or to bind strongly to the hiv protein they be able to suppress viral budding by suppress viral bud the researcher be able to trap the hiv virus in the cell and allow for the cell to undergo apoptosis natural cell death associate professor mikako fujita have state that the approach be not yet available to hiv patient because the research team have to conduct further research on combine the drug therapy that currently exist with this and apoptosis approach to lead to complete recovery from hiv viral induction of apoptosis occurs when one or several cell of a living organism be infect with a virus lead to cell death cell death in organism be necessary for the normal development of cell and the cell cycle maturation it be also important in maintain the regular function and activity of cell virus can trigger apoptosis of infected cell via a range of mechanism include receptor bind activation of protein kinase r pkr interaction with expression of viral protein couple to mhc protein on the surface of the infect cell allow recognition by cell of the immune system such a natural killer and cytotoxic t cell that then induce the infected cell to undergo apoptosis canine distemper virus cdv be know to cause apoptosis in central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of infected dog in vivo and in vitro apoptosis cause by cdv be typically induced via the extrinsic pathway which activate caspase that disrupt cellular function and eventually lead to the cell death in normal cell cdv activates first which work a the initiator protein follow by the executioner protein however apoptosis induce by cdv in hela cell do not involve the initiator protein hela cell apoptosis cause by cdv follow a different mechanism than that in vero cell line this change in the caspase cascade suggest cdv induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway exclude the need for the initiator the executioner protein be instead activate by the internal stimulus cause by viral infection not a caspase cascade the oropouche virus orov be find in the family bunyaviridae the study of apoptosis bring on by bunyaviridae be initiate in when it be observe that apoptosis be induce by the la crosse virus into the kidney cell of baby hamster and into the brain of baby mouse orov be a disease that be transmit between human by the biting midge culicoides paraensis it be refer to a a zoonotic arbovirus and cause febrile illness characterize by the onset of a sudden fever know a oropouche fever the oropouche virus also cause disruption in cultured cell cell that be cultivate in distinct and specific condition an example of this can be see in hela cell whereby the cell begin to degenerate shortly after they be infect with the use of gel electrophoresis it can be observe that orov cause dna fragmentation in hela cell it can be interpret by count measuring and analyze the cell of the cell population when hela cell be infect with orov the cytochrome c be release from the membrane of the mitochondrion into the cytosol of the cell this type of interaction show that apoptosis be activate via an intrinsic pathway in order for apoptosis to occur within orov viral uncoating viral internalization along with the replication of cell be necessary apoptosis in some virus be activate by extracellular stimulus however study have demonstrate that the orov infection cause apoptosis to be activate through intracellular stimulus and involve the mitochondrion many virus encode protein that can inhibit apoptosis several virus encode viral homologs of these homologs can inhibit proapoptotic protein such a bax and bak which be essential for the activation of apoptosis example of viral protein include the virus protein and the adenovirus protein some virus express caspase inhibitor that inhibit caspase activity and an example be the crma protein of cowpox virus whilst a number of virus can block the effect of tnf and fa for example the protein of myxoma virus can bind tnf prevent it from bind the tnf receptor and induce a response furthermore many virus express inhibitor that can bind and inhibit it transcriptional transactivation activity a a consequence can not induce apoptosis since it can not induce the expression of proapoptotic protein the adenovirus protein and the hepatitis b virus hbx protein be example of viral protein that can perform such a function virus can remain intact from apoptosis in particular in the latter stage of infection they can be export in the apoptotic body that pinch off from the surface of the die cell and the fact that they be engulf by phagocyte prevents the initiation of a host response this favour the spread of the virus program cell death in plant have a number of molecular similarity to that of animal apoptosis but it also have difference notable one be the presence of a cell wall and the lack of an immune system that remove the piece of the dead cell instead of an immune response the die cell synthesizes substance to break itself down and place them in a vacuole that rupture a the cell die whether this whole process resembles animal apoptosis closely enough to warrant use the name apoptosis a oppose to the more general program cell death be unclear the characterization of the caspase allow the development of caspase inhibitor which can be use to determine whether a cellular process involve active caspase use these inhibitor it be discover that cell can die while display a morphology similar to apoptosis without caspase activation later study link this phenomenon to the release of aif factor from the mitochondrion and it translocation into the nucleus mediate by it nls nuclear localization signal inside the mitochondrion aif be anchor to the inner membrane in order to be release the protein be cleave by a calpain protease anoikis apoptotic dna fragmentation atromentin induces apoptosis in human leukemia cell autolysis

hela cell stain for nuclear dna with the blue fluorescent hoechst dye the central and rightmost cell be in interphase thus their entire nucleus be label on the left a cell be go through mitosis and it dna have condense in cell biology the pl from latin or meaning kernel or seed be a organelle find in eukaryotic cell eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus but a few cell type such a mammalian red blood cell have no nucleus and a few others include osteoclast have many the cell nucleus contain all of the cell genome except for a small fraction of mitochondrial dna organize a multiple long linear dna molecule in a complex with a large variety of protein such a histone to form chromosome the gene within these chromosome be structure in such a way to promote cell function the nucleus maintain the integrity of gene and control the activity of the cell by regulate gene nucleus be therefore the control center of the cell the main structure make up the nucleus be the nuclear envelope a double membrane that enclose the entire organelle and isolate it content from the cellular cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix which include the nuclear lamina a network within the nucleus that add mechanical support much like the cytoskeleton which support the cell a a whole because the nuclear envelope be impermeable to large molecule nuclear pore be require to regulate nuclear transport of molecule across the envelope the pore cross both nuclear membrane provide a channel through which large molecule must be actively transport by carrier protein while allow free movement of small molecule and ion movement of large molecule such a protein and rna through the pore be require for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosome although the interior of the nucleus do not contain any subcompartments it content be not uniform and a number of nuclear body exist make up of unique protein rna molecule and particular part of the chromosome the of these be the nucleolus which be mainly involve in the assembly of ribosome after be produce in the nucleolus ribosome be export to the cytoplasm where they translate mrna old know depiction of cell and their nucleus by antonie van leeuwenhoek drawing of a chironomus salivary gland cell publish by walther flemming in the nucleus contain polytene chromosome the nucleus be the first organelle to be discover what be most likely the old preserved drawing date back to the early microscopist antonie van leeuwenhoek he observe a lumen the nucleus in the red blood cell of salmon unlike mammalian red blood cell those of other vertebrate still contain nucleus the nucleus be also describe by franz bauer in and in more detail in by scottish botanist robert brown in a talk at the linnean society of london brown be study orchid under the microscope when he observe an opaque area which he call the areola or nucleus in the cell of the flower outer layer he do not suggest a potential function in matthias schleiden propose that the nucleus play a role in generate cell thus he introduce the name cytoblast cell builder he believe that he have observe new cell assemble around cytoblasts franz meyen be a strong opponent of this view have already describe cell multiply by division and believe that many cell would have no nucleus the idea that cell can be generate de novo by the cytoblast or otherwise contradict work by robert remak and rudolf virchow who decisively propagate the new paradigm that cell be generate solely by cell omnis cellula e cellula the function of the nucleus remain unclear between and oscar hertwig publish several study on the fertilization of sea urchin egg show that the nucleus of the sperm enter the oocyte and fuse with it nucleus this be the first time it be suggest that an individual develops from a single nucleate cell this be in contradiction to ernst haeckel theory that the complete phylogeny of a specie would be repeat during embryonic development include generation of the first nucleate cell from a monerula a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm urschleim therefore the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization be discuss for quite some time however hertwig confirm his observation in other animal group include amphibian and molluscs eduard strasburger produce the same result for plant in this pave the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity in august weismann postulate the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cell for heredity the function of the nucleus a carrier of genetic information become clear only later after mitosis be discover and the mendelian rule be rediscover at the beginning of the century the chromosome theory of heredity be therefore develop the nucleus be the large organelle in animal cell in mammalian cell the average diameter of the nucleus be approximately micrometres µm which occupy about of the total cell volume the content of the nucleus be hold in the nucleoplasm similar to the cytoplasm in the rest of the cell the fluid component of this be term the nucleosol similar to the cytosol in the cytoplasm in most type of granulocyte a white blood cell the nucleus be lobated and can be or envelope and the eukaryotic cell nucleus visible in this diagram be the double membrane of the nuclear envelope the dna complexed a chromatin and the nucleolus within the cell nucleus be a viscous liquid call nucleoplasm similar to the cytoplasm find outside the nucleus a cross section of a nuclear pore on the surface of the nuclear envelope other diagram label show the outer ring spoke basket and filaments the nuclear envelope otherwise know a nuclear membrane consists of two cellular membrane an inner and an outer membrane arrange parallel to one another and separate by to nanometre nm the nuclear envelope completely enclose the nucleus and separate the cell genetic material from the surround cytoplasm serve a a barrier to prevent macromolecule from diffuse freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm the outer nuclear membrane be continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum rer and be similarly stud with ribosome the space between the membrane be call the perinuclear space and be continuous with the rer lumen nuclear pore which provide aqueous channel through the envelope be compose of multiple protein collectively refer to a nucleoporins the pore be about million dalton in molecular weight and consist of around in yeast to several hundred protein in vertebrate the pore be nm in total diameter however the gap through which molecule freely diffuse be only about nm wide due to the presence of regulatory system within the center of the pore this size selectively allow the passage of small molecule while prevent large molecule such a nucleic acid and large protein from inappropriately enter or exit the nucleus these large molecule must be actively transport into the nucleus instead the nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about to pore throughout it envelope each of which contain an structure at a position where the inner and outer membrane fuse attach to the ring be a structure call the nuclear basket that extend into the nucleoplasm and a series of filamentous extension that reach into the cytoplasm both structure serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins most protein ribosomal subunit and some dna be transport through the pore complex in a process mediate by a family of transport factor know a karyopherins those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus be also call importins whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus be call exportins most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo although some use adaptor protein steroid hormone such a cortisol and aldosterone as well a other small molecule involve in intercellular signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm where they bind nuclear receptor protein that be traffic into the nucleus there they serve a transcription factor when bound to their ligand in the absence of a ligand many such receptor function a histone deacetylases that repress gene expression in animal cell two network of intermediate filament provide the nucleus with mechanical support the nuclear lamina form an organize meshwork on the internal face of the envelope while less organized support be provide on the cytosolic face of the envelope both system provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchor site for chromosome and nuclear pore the nuclear lamina be compose mostly of lamin protein like all protein lamins be synthesize in the cytoplasm and later transport to the nucleus interior where they be assemble before be incorporate into the exist network of nuclear lamina lamins find on the cytosolic face of the membrane such a emerin and nesprin bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support lamins be also find inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure know a the veil that be visible use fluorescence microscopy the actual function of the veil be not clear although it be exclude from the nucleolus and be present during interphase lamin structure that make up the veil such a bind chromatin and disrupt their structure inhibit transcription of gene like the component of other intermediate filament the lamin monomer contain an domain use by two monomer to coil around each other form a dimer structure call a coiled coil two of these dimer structure then join side by side in an antiparallel arrangement to form a tetramer call a protofilament eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that be twist to form a ropelike filament these filament can be assemble or disassemble in a dynamic manner meaning that change in the length of the filament depend on the compete rate of filament addition and removal mutation in lamin gene lead to defect in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorder know a laminopathies the most notable laminopathy be the family of disease know a progeria which cause the appearance of premature age in it sufferer the exact mechanism by which the associate biochemical change give rise to the age phenotype be not well understood a mouse fibroblast nucleus in which dna be stain blue the distinct chromosome territory of chromosome red and chromosome green be stain with fluorescent in situ hybridization the cell nucleus contain the majority of the cell genetic material in the form of multiple linear dna molecule organize into structure call chromosome each human cell contain roughly two meter of dna during most of the cell cycle these be organize in a complex know a chromatin and during cell division the chromatin can be see to form the chromosome familiar from a karyotype a small fraction of the cell gene be locate instead in the mitochondrion there be two type of chromatin euchromatin be the less compact dna form and contain gene that be frequently express by the cell the other type heterochromatin be the more compact form and contain dna that be infrequently transcribe this structure be further categorize into facultative heterochromatin consist of gene that be organize a heterochromatin only in certain cell type or at certain stage of development and constitutive heterochromatin that consist of chromosome structural component such a telomere and centromere during interphase the chromatin organize itself into discrete individual patch call chromosome territory active gene which be generally find in the euchromatic region of the chromosome tend to be locate towards the chromosome territory boundary antibody to certain type of chromatin organization in particular nucleosomes have be associate with a number of autoimmune disease such a systemic lupus erythematosus these be know a antibody ana and have also be observe in concert with multiple sclerosis a part of general immune system dysfunction a in the case of progeria the role play by the antibody in induce the symptom of autoimmune disease be not obvious an electron micrograph of a cell nucleus show the darkly stain nucleolus rendering of nucleus with location of nucleolus the nucleolus be the large of the discrete densely stain membraneless structure know a nuclear body find in the nucleus it form around tandem repeat of rdna dna cod for ribosomal rna rrna these region be call nucleolar organizer region nor the main role of the nucleolus be to synthesize rrna and assemble ribosome the structural cohesion of the nucleolus depend on it activity a ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus result in the transient association of nucleolar component facilitate further ribosomal assembly and hence further association this model be support by observation that inactivation of rdna result in intermingling of nucleolar structure in the first step of ribosome assembly a protein call rna polymerase i transcribe rdna which form a large precursor this be cleave into the subunit and rrna the transcription processing and assembly of rrna occurs in the nucleolus aid by small nucleolar rna snorna molecules some of which be derive from spliced intron from messenger rna encode gene relate to ribosomal function the assemble ribosomal subunit be the large structure pass through the nuclear pore when observe under the electron microscope the nucleolus can be see to consist of three distinguishable region the innermost fibrillar center fcs surround by the dense fibrillar component dfc that contain fibrillarin and nucleolin which in turn be border by the granular component gc that contain the protein nucleophosmin transcription of the rdna occur either in the fc or at the boundary and therefore when rdna transcription in the cell be increase more fcs be detect most of the cleavage and modification of rrnas occurs in the dfc while the latter step involve protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunit occur in the gc nuclear structure size structure name structure diameter cajal body µm clastosomes µm pika µm pml body µm paraspeckles µm speckle nm besides the nucleolus the nucleus contain a number of other nuclear body these include cajal body gemini of cajal body polymorphic interphase karyosomal association pika promyelocytic leukaemia pml body paraspeckles and splice speckle although little be know about a number of these domain they be significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm be not a uniform mixture but rather contain organize functional subdomains other subnuclear structure appear a part of abnormal disease process for example the presence of small intranuclear rod have be report in some case of nemaline myopathy this condition typically result from mutation in actin and the rod themselves consist of mutant actin as well a other cytoskeletal protein body and a nucleus typically contain between and compact structure call cajal body or coiled body cb whose diameter measure between µm and µm depend on the cell type and specie when see under an electron microscope they resemble ball of tangle thread and be dense focus of distribution for the protein coilin cbs be involve in a number of different role relate to rna process specifically small nucleolar rna snorna and small nuclear rna snrna maturation and histone mrna modification similar to cajal body be gemini of cajal body or gem whose name be derive from the gemini constellation in reference to their close twin relationship with cbs gem be similar in size and shape to cbs and in fact be virtually indistinguishable under the microscope unlike cbs gem do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snrnps but do contain a protein call survival of motor neuron smn whose function relate to snrnp biogenesis gem be believe to assist cbs in snrnp biogenesis though it have also be suggest from microscopy evidence that cbs and gem be different manifestation of the same structure later ultrastructural study have show gem to be twin of cajal body with the difference be in the coilin component cajal body be smn positive and coilin positive and gem be smn positive and coilin negative and ptf pika domain or polymorphic interphase karyosomal association be first describe in microscopy study in their function remain unclear though they be not think to be associate with active dna replication transcription or rna processing they have be find to often associate with discrete domain define by dense localization of the transcription factor ptf which promote transcription of small nuclear rna snrna promyelocytic leukemia body pml body be spherical body find scatter throughout the nucleoplasm measure around µm they be know by a number of other name include nuclear domain kremer body and pml oncogenic domain pml body be name after one of their major component the promyelocytic leukemia protein pml they be often see in the nucleus in association with cajal body and cleavage body mouse which be unable to create pml body develop normally without obvious ill effect show that pml body be not require for most essential biological process splice speckle be subnuclear structure that be enrich in rna splicing factor and be locate in the interchromatin region of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cell at the level they appear a irregular punctate structure which vary in size and shape and when examine by electron microscopy they be see a cluster of interchromatin granule speckle be dynamic structure and both their protein and component can cycle continuously between speckle and other nuclear location include active transcription site study on the composition structure and behaviour of speckle have provide a model for understand the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the machinery splice snrnps and other splice protein necessary for process because of a cell change requirement the composition and location of these body change accord to mrna transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins the splicing speckle be also know a nuclear speckle nuclear speck splice factor compartment sf compartment interchromatin granule cluster igcs and b snurposomes b snurposomes be find in the amphibian oocyte nucleus and in drosophila melanogaster embryo b snurposomes appear alone or attach to the cajal body in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nucleus igcs function a storage site for the splicing factor discover by fox et al in paraspeckles be irregularly shaped compartment in the interchromatin space of the nucleus first document in hela cell where there be generally per nucleus paraspeckles be now know to also exist in all human primary cell transform cell line and tissue section their name be derive from their distribution in the nucleus the para be short for parallel and the speckle refers to the splice speckle to which they be always in close proximity paraspeckles be dynamic structure that be alter in response to change in cellular metabolic activity they be transcription dependent and in the absence of rna pol ii transcription the paraspeckle disappears and all of it associate protein component cfi m and psf form a crescent shape perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus this phenomenon be demonstrate during the cell cycle in the cell cycle paraspeckles be present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase during telophase when the two daughter nucleus be form there be no rna pol ii transcription so the protein component instead form a perinucleolar cap perichromatin perichromatin fibril be visible only under electron microscope they be locate next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and be hypothesize to be the site of active processing clastosomes be small nuclear body µm describe a have a thick due to the peripheral capsule around these body this name be derive from the greek klastos broken and soma body clastosomes be not typically present in normal cell make them hard to detect they form under high proteolytic condition within the nucleus and degrade once there be a decrease in activity or if cell be treat with proteasome inhibitor the scarcity of clastosomes in cell indicate that they be not require for proteasome function osmotic stress have also be show to cause the formation of clastosomes these nuclear body contain catalytic and regulatory of the proteasome and it substrate indicate that clastosomes be site for degrade proteins the fougaro system greek fougaro chimney be a system in the nucleus that may be a mechanism to recycle or remove molecule from the cell to the external medium the molecule or peptide be ubiquitinated before be release from the nucleus of the cell the ubiquitinated molecule be release independently or associate with endosomal protein such a beclin the nucleus provide a site for genetic transcription that be segregate from the location of translation in the cytoplasm allow level of gene regulation that be not available to prokaryotes the main function of the cell nucleus be to control gene expression and mediate the replication of dna during the cell cycle the nucleus be an organelle find in eukaryotic cell inside it fully enclose nuclear membrane it contain the majority of the cell genetic material this material be organize a dna molecule along with a variety of protein to form chromosome the nuclear envelope allow the nucleus to control it content and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary this be important for control process on either side of the nuclear membrane in most case where a cytoplasmic process need to be restrict a key participant be remove to the nucleus where it interact with transcription factor to downregulate the production of certain enzyme in the pathway this regulatory mechanism occur in the case of glycolysis a cellular pathway for break down glucose to produce energy hexokinase be an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis form from glucose at high concentration of a molecule make later from a regulator protein remove hexokinase to the nucleus where it form a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear protein to reduce the expression of gene involve in glycolysis in order to control which gene be be transcribe the cell separate some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulate gene expression from physical access to the dna until they be activate by other signal pathway this prevents even low level of inappropriate gene expression for example in the case of gene which be involve in most inflammatory response transcription be induce in response to a signal pathway such a that initiate by the signal molecule bind to a cell membrane receptor result in the recruitment of signal protein and eventually activate the transcription factor a nuclear localisation signal on the protein allow it to be transport through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus where it stimulate the transcription of the target gene the compartmentalization allow the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mrna eukaryotic mrna contains intron that must be remove before be translate to produce functional protein the splicing be do inside the nucleus before the mrna can be access by ribosome for translation without the nucleus ribosome would translate newly transcribe unprocessed mrna result in malformed and nonfunctional protein a micrograph of ongoing gene transcription of ribosomal rna illustrate the grow primary transcript begin indicate the end of the dna where new rna synthesis begin end indicate the end where the primary transcript be almost complete gene expression first involve transcription in which dna be use a a template to produce rna in the case of gene encode protein that rna produce from this process be messenger rna mrna which then need to be translate by ribosome to form a protein a ribosome be locate outside the nucleus mrna produce need to be export since the nucleus be the site of transcription it also contain a variety of protein that either directly mediate transcription or be involve in regulate the process these protein include helicases which unwind the dna molecule to facilitate access to it rna polymerase which bind to the dna promoter to synthesize the grow rna molecule topoisomerases which change the amount of supercoiling in dna help it wind and unwind as well a a large variety of transcription factor that regulate expression of newly synthesize mrna molecule be know a primary transcript or they must undergo modification in the nucleus before be export to the cytoplasm mrna that appear in the cytoplasm without these modification be degrade rather than use for protein translation the three main modification be cap polyadenylation and rna splice while in the nucleus be associate with a variety of protein in complex know a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle hnrnps addition of the cap occurs and be the first step in modification the tail be only added after transcription be complete rna splice carry out by a complex call the spliceosome be the process by which intron or region of dna that do not code for protein be remove from the and the remain exon connect to a single continuous molecule this process normally occur after cap and polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis be complete in transcript with many exon many include those encode antibody can be splice in multiple way to produce different mature mrna that encode different protein sequence this process be know a alternative splicing and allow production of a large variety of protein from a limited amount of dna macromolecule such a rna and protein be actively transport across the nuclear membrane in a process call the nuclear transport cycle the entry and exit of large molecule from the nucleus be tightly control by the nuclear pore complex although small molecule can enter the nucleus without regulation macromolecule such a rna and proteins require association karyopherins call importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit cargo protein that must be translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequence know a nuclear localization signal which be bind by importins while those transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signal bind by exportins the ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo be regulate by gtpases enzyme that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate gtp to release energy the key gtpase in nuclear transport be ran which can bind either gtp or gdp guanosine diphosphate depend on whether it be locate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm whereas importins depend on rangtp to dissociate from their cargo exportins require rangtp in order to bind to their cargo nuclear import depend on the importin bind it cargo in the cytoplasm and carry it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus inside the nucleus rangtp act to separate the cargo from the importin allow the importin to exit the nucleus and be reuse nuclear export be similar a the exportin bind the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitate by rangtp exit through the nuclear pore and separate from it cargo in the cytoplasm specialize export protein exist for translocation of mature mrna and trna to the cytoplasm after modification be complete this mechanism be important due to these molecule central role in protein translation of a protein due to incomplete excision of exon or of amino acid could have negative consequence for the cell thus incompletely modify rna that reach the cytoplasm be degrade rather than use in translation and an image of a newt lung cell stain with fluorescent dye during metaphase the mitotic spindle can be see stain green attach to the two set of chromosome stain light blue all chromosome but one be already at the metaphase plate during it lifetime a nucleus may be break down or destroy either in the process of cell division or a a consequence of apoptosis the process of programmed cell death during these event the structural component of the nucleus the envelope and lamina can be systematically degrade in most cell the disassembly of the nuclear envelope mark the end of the prophase of mitosis however this disassembly of the nucleus be not a universal feature of mitosis and do not occur in all cell some unicellular eukaryote yeast undergo closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope remain intact in closed mitosis the daughter chromosome migrate to opposite pole of the nucleus which then divide in two the cell of high eukaryote however usually undergo open mitosis which be characterize by breakdown of the nuclear envelope the daughter chromosome then migrate to opposite pole of the mitotic spindle and new nucleus reassemble around them at a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis the cell divide to form two cell in order for this process to be possible each of the new daughter cell must have a full set of gene a process require replication of the chromosome as well a segregation of the separate set this occurs by the replicate chromosome the sister chromatid attach to microtubule which in turn be attach to different centrosome the sister chromatid can then be pull to separate location in the cell in many cell the centrosome be locate in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus the microtubule would be unable to attach to the chromatid in the presence of the nuclear envelope therefore the early stage in the cell cycle begin in prophase and until around prometaphase the nuclear membrane be dismantled likewise during the same period the nuclear lamina be also disassemble a process regulate by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinase such a the protein kinase towards the end of the cell cycle the nuclear membrane be reform and around the same time the nuclear lamina be reassemble by dephosphorylating the lamins however in dinoflagellates the nuclear envelope remain intact the centrosome be locate in the cytoplasm and the microtubule come in contact with chromosome whose centromeric region be incorporate into the nuclear envelope the closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle in many other protist ciliate sporozoan and fungi the centrosome be intranuclear and their nuclear envelope also do not disassemble during cell division apoptosis be a controlled process in which the cell structural component be destroy result in death of the cell change associate with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and it content for example in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina the destruction of the lamin network be control by specialized apoptotic protease call caspase which cleave the lamin protein and thus degrade the nucleus structural integrity lamin cleavage be sometimes use a a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assay for early apoptotic activity cell that express mutant lamins be deficient in nuclear change relate to apoptosis suggest that lamins play a role in initiate the event that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus inhibition of lamin assembly itself be an inducer of apoptosis the nuclear envelope act a a barrier that prevent both dna and rna virus from enter the nucleus some virus require access to protein inside the nucleus in order to replicate assemble dna virus such a herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus and exit by bud through the inner nuclear membrane this process be accompany by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane initially it have be suspect that immunoglobulin in general and autoantibody in particular do not enter the nucleus now there be a body of evidence that under pathological condition lupus erythematosus igg can enter the nucleus most eukaryotic cell type usually have a single nucleus but some have no nucleus while others have several this can result from normal development a in the maturation of mammalian red blood cell or from faulty cell division human red blood cell like those of other mammal lack nucleus this occur a a normal part of the cell development an anucleated cell contain no nucleus and be therefore incapable of divide to produce daughter cell the anucleated cell be the mammalian red blood cell or erythrocyte which also lack other organelle such a mitochondrion and serf primarily a a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lung to the body tissue erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow where they lose their nucleus organelle and ribosomes the nucleus be expel during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte which be the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte the presence of mutagen may induce the release of some immature micronucleated erythrocytes into the bloodstream anucleated cell can also arise from flaw cell division in which one daughter lack a nucleus and the other have two nucleus in flower plant this condition occur in sieve tube element multinucleated cell contain multiple nucleus most acantharean specie of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cell other example include the intestinal parasite in the genus giardia which have two nuclei per cell in human skeletal muscle cell call myocytes and syncytium become multinucleated during development the result arrangement of nucleus near the periphery of the cell allow maximal intracellular space for myofibril other multinucleate cell in the human be osteoclasts a type of bone cell multinucleated and binucleated cell can also be abnormal in human for example cell arise from the fusion of monocyte and macrophage know a giant multinucleated cell sometimes accompany inflammation and be also implicate in tumor formation a number of dinoflagellate be know to have two nucleus unlike other multinucleated cell these nucleus contain two distinct lineage of dna one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom the mitochondrion and the plastid of the diatom somehow remain functional a the major define characteristic of the eukaryotic cell the nucleus evolutionary origin have be the subject of much speculation four major hypothesis have be propose to explain the existence of the nucleus although none have yet earn widespread support the first model know a the syntrophic model propose that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria create the eukaryotic cell organism of the archaea and bacteria domain have no cell nucleus it be hypothesize that the symbiosis originate when ancient archaea similar to modern methanogenic archaea invade and live within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria eventually form the early nucleus this theory be analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondrion and chloroplast which be think to have develop from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between and aerobic bacteria the archaeal origin of the nucleus be support by observation that archaea and eukarya have similar gene for certain protein include histone observation that myxobacteria be motile can form multicellular complex and posse kinase and g protein similar to eukarya support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell a second model propose that cell evolve from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage this model be base on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that posse a nuclear structure with primitive pore and other compartmentalize membrane structure a similar proposal state that a cell the chronocyte evolve first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell the most controversial model know a viral eukaryogenesis posit that the nucleus along with other eukaryotic feature originate from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus the suggestion be base on similarity between eukaryote and virus such a linear dna strand mrna cap and tight binding to protein analogize histone to viral envelope one version of the proposal suggest that the nucleus evolve in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular predator another variant propose that eukaryote originate from early archaea infect by poxvirus on the basis of observed similarity between the dna polymerases in modern poxvirus and eukaryotes it have be suggest that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be relate to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis a more recent proposal the exomembrane hypothesis suggest that the nucleus instead originate from a single ancestral cell that evolve a second exterior cell

relationship between the continuous fourier transform and the discrete fourier transform leave column a continuous function top and it fourier transform bottom column periodic summation of the original function top fourier transform bottom be zero except at discrete point the inverse transform be a sum of sinusoid call fourier series column original function be discretized multiply by a dirac comb top it fourier transform bottom be a periodic summation dtft of the original transform right column the dft bottom compute discrete sample of the continuous dtft the inverse dft top be a periodic summation of the original sample the fft algorithm compute one cycle of the dft and it inverse be one cycle of the dft inverse depiction of a fourier transform upper left and it periodic summation dtft in the low leave corner the spectral sequence at a upper right and b low right be respectively compute from a one cycle of the periodic summation of s t and b one cycle of the periodic summation of the s nt sequence the respective formula be a the fourier series integral and b the summation it similarity to the original transform s f and it relative computational ease be often the motivation for compute a dft sequence in mathematics the fourier transform convert a finite sequence of sample of a function into a sequence of sample of the fourier transform dtft which be a function of frequency the interval at which the dtft be sample be the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence an inverse dft be a fourier series use the dtft sample a coefficient of complex sinusoid at the corresponding dtft frequency it have the same a the original input sequence the dft be therefore say to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence if the original sequence span all the value of a function it dtft be continuous and periodic and the dft provide discrete sample of one cycle if the original sequence be one cycle of a periodic function the dft provide all the value of one dtft cycle the dft be the most important discrete transform use to perform fourier analysis in many practical application in digital signal process the function be any quantity or signal that vary over time such a the pressure of a sound wave a radio signal or daily temperature reading sample over a finite time interval often define by a window function in image process the sample can be the value of pixel along a row or column of a raster image the dft be also use to efficiently solve partial differential equation and to perform other operation such a convolution or multiply large integer since it deal with a finite amount of data it can be implement in computer by numerical algorithm or even dedicate hardware these implementation usually employ efficient fast fourier transform fft algorithms so much so that the term fft and dft be often use interchangeably prior to it current usage the fft initialism may have also be use for the ambiguous term finite fourier transform the discrete fourier transform transform a sequence of n complex number into another sequence of complex number which be define by where the last expression follow from the first one by euler formula the transform be sometimes denote by the symbol a in or or can also be evaluate outside the domain and that extend sequence be accordingly other sequence of index be sometimes used such a if be even and if be odd which amount to swap the left and right half of the result of the transform can be interpret or derive in various way for example the normalization factor multiply the dft and idft here and and the sign of the exponent be merely convention and differ in some treatment the only requirement of these convention be that the dft and idft have exponent and that the product of their normalization factor be a normalization of for both the dft and idft for instance make the transforms unitary a discrete impulse at n and otherwise might transform to for all k use normalization factor for dft and for idft a dc signal at k and otherwise might inversely transform to for all use for dft and for idft which be consistent with view dc a the mean average of the signal let and here we demonstrate how to calculate the dft of use the discrete fourier transform be an invertible linear transformation with denote the set of complex number it inverse be know a inverse discrete fourier transform idft in other word for any an n complex vector have a dft and an idft which be in turn complex vector the inverse transform be give by the dft be a linear transform if and then for any complex number and frequency reverse the time replace by in corresponds to reverse the frequency by mathematically if represent the vector then if then in if then and imaginary this table show some mathematical operation on in the time domain and the corresponding effect on it dft in the frequency domain property time domain frequency domain real part in time imaginary part in time real part in frequency imaginary part in frequency orthogonality the vector form an orthogonal basis over the set of n complex vector where be the kronecker delta in the last step the summation be trivial if where it be n and otherwise be a geometric series that can be explicitly sum to obtain zero this orthogonality condition can be use to derive the formula for the idft from the definition of the dft and be equivalent to the unitarity property below the plancherel theorem and parseval theorem if and be the dfts of and respectively then the parseval theorem state where the star denote complex conjugation plancherel theorem be a special case of the parseval theorem and state these theorem be also equivalent to the unitary condition below the periodicity can be show directly from the definition similarly it can be show that the idft formula lead to a periodic extension multiplying by a linear phase for some integer m corresponds to a circular shift of the output be replace by where the subscript be interpret modulo n periodically similarly a circular shift of the input correspond to multiply the output by a linear phase mathematically if represent the vector then if then and convolution theorem and the convolution theorem for the fourier transform indicate that a convolution of two infinite sequence can be obtain a the inverse transform of the product of the individual transform an important simplification occur when the sequence be of finite length in term of the dft and inverse dft it can be write a follow which be the convolution of the sequence with a sequence extend by periodic summation similarly the of and be give by when either sequence contain a string of zero of length of the circular convolution output be equivalent to value of method have also be develop to use this property a part of an efficient process that construct with an or sequence potentially much long than the practical transform size two such method be call and the efficiency result from the fact that a direct evaluation of either summation above require operation for an output sequence of length an indirect method use transforms can take advantage of the efficiency of the fast fourier transform fft to achieve much good performance furthermore convolution can be use to efficiently compute dfts via rader fft algorithm and bluestein fft algorithm convolution theorem duality it can also be show that which be the circular convolution of and interpolation the trigonometric interpolation polynomial where the coefficient x be give by the dft of x above satisfy the interpolation property for for even n notice that the nyquist component be handle specially this interpolation be not unique aliasing implies that one could add n to any of the frequency change to without change the interpolation property but give different value in between the point the choice above however be typical because it have two useful property first it consist of sinusoid whose frequency have the small possible magnitude the interpolation be bandlimited second if the be real number then be real as well in contrast the most obvious trigonometric interpolation polynomial be the one in which the frequency range from to instead of roughly to a above similar to the inverse dft formula this interpolation do not minimize the slope and be not generally for real it use be a common mistake the unitary dft another way of look at the dft be to note that in the above discussion the dft can be express a the dft matrix a vandermonde matrix introduce by sylvester in where be a primitive n th root of unity the inverse transform be then give by the inverse of the above matrix with unitary normalization constants the dft become a unitary transformation define by a unitary matrix where be the determinant function the determinant be the product of the eigenvalue which be always or a describe below in a real vector space a unitary transformation can be think of as simply a rigid rotation of the coordinate system and all of the property of a rigid rotation can be find in the unitary dft the orthogonality of the dft be now express a an orthonormality condition which arise in many area of mathematics a describe in root of unity if be define a the unitary dft of the vector then and the parseval theorem be express a if we view the dft a just a coordinate transformation which simply specify the component of a vector in a new coordinate system then the above be just the statement that the dot product of two vector be preserve under a unitary dft transformation for the special case this imply that the length of a vector be preserve as well this be just plancherel theorem a consequence of the circular convolution theorem be that the dft matrix diagonalize any circulant matrix express the inverse dft in term of the dft a useful property of the dft be that the inverse dft can be easily express in term of the forward dft via several trick for example in computation it be often convenient to only implement a fast fourier transform correspond to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first first we can compute the inverse dft by reverse all but one of the input duhamel et al a usual the subscript be interpret modulo n thus for we have second one can also conjugate the input and output third a variant of this conjugation trick which be sometimes preferable because it require no modification of the data value involve swap real and imaginary part which can be do on a computer simply by modify pointer define a with it real and imaginary part be if then be equivalently equal then that be the inverse transform be the same a the forward transform with the real and imaginary part swap for both input and output up to a normalization duhamel et al the conjugation trick can also be use to define a new transform closely relate to the dft that be be which be it own inverse in particular be clearly it own inverse a closely related involutory transformation by a factor of be since the factor in cancel the for real input the real part of be none other than the discrete hartley transform which be also involutory eigenvalue and eigenvectors the eigenvalue of the dft matrix be simple and whereas the eigenvectors be complicate not unique and be the subject of ongoing research consider the unitary form define above for the dft of length n where this matrix satisfy the matrix polynomial equation this can be see from the inverse property above operating twice give the original data in reverse order so operate four time give back the original data and be thus the identity matrix this mean that the eigenvalue satisfy the equation therefore the eigenvalue of be the fourth root of unity be i or i since there be only four distinct eigenvalue for this matrix they have some multiplicity the multiplicity give the number of linearly independent eigenvectors correspond to each eigenvalue there be n independent eigenvectors a unitary matrix be never defective the problem of their multiplicity be solve by mcclellan and park although it be later show to have be equivalent to a problem solve by gauss dickinson and steiglitz the multiplicity depend on the value of n modulo and be give by the follow table multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ of the unitary dft matrix a a function of the transform size n in term of an integer m size n λ λ λ i λ i m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m otherwise state the characteristic polynomial of be no simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors be know moreover the eigenvectors be not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue be also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue various researcher have propose different choice of eigenvectors select to satisfy useful property like orthogonality and to have simple form mcclellan and park dickinson and steiglitz grünbaum atakishiyev and wolf candan et al hanna et al gurevich and hadani a straightforward approach be to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous fourier transform of which the most famous be the gaussian function since periodic summation of the function mean discretizing it frequency spectrum and discretization mean periodic summation of the spectrum the discretized and periodically sum gaussian function yield an eigenvector of the discrete transform the closed form expression for the series can be express by jacobi theta function a two other simple analytical eigenvectors for special dft period n be find kong for dft period n l k where k be an integer the following be an eigenvector of dft for dft period n l k where k be an integer the following be an eigenvector of dft the choice of eigenvectors of the dft matrix have become important in recent year in order to define a discrete analogue of the fractional fourier dft matrix can be take to fractional power by exponentiating the eigenvalue rubio and santhanam for the continuous fourier transform the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions be the hermite function so various discrete analogue of these have be employ a the eigenvectors of the dft such a the kravchuk polynomial atakishiyev and wolf the best choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete fourier transform remain an open question however uncertainty principle probabilistic uncertainty principle if the random variable be constrain by then may be consider to represent a discrete probability mass function of with an associated probability mass function construct from the transform variable for the case of continuous function and the heisenberg uncertainty principle state that where and be the variance of and respectively with the equality attain in the case of a suitably normalized gaussian distribution although the variance may be analogously define for the dft an analogous uncertainty principle be not useful because the uncertainty will not be still a meaningful uncertainty principle have be introduce by massar and spindel however the hirschman entropic uncertainty will have a useful analog for the case of the dft the hirschman uncertainty principle be express in term of the shannon entropy of the two probability function in the discrete case the shannon entropy be define a and and the entropic uncertainty principle become the equality be obtain for equal to translation and modulation of a suitably normalized kronecker comb of period where be any exact integer divisor of the probability mass function will then be proportional to a suitably translate kronecker comb of period deterministic uncertainty principle there be also a deterministic uncertainty principle that use signal sparsity or the number of coefficient let and be the number of element of the time and frequency sequence and respectively then a an immediate consequence of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric mean one also have both uncertainty principle be show to be tight for sequence discrete impulse train and find practical use for signal recovery application dft of real and purely imaginary signal be real number a they often be in practical application then the dft be even symmetric where denote complex conjugation it follow that for even and be and the remainder of the dft be completely specify by just complex number be purely imaginary number then the dft be odd symmetric where denote complex conjugation it be possible to shift the transform sample in time frequency domain by some real shift a and b respectively this be sometimes know a a dft or also call the dft or dft and have analogous property to the ordinary dft most often shift of half a sample be use while the ordinary dft corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domain produce a signal that be in frequency domain and vice versa for thus the specific case of be know a an discrete fourier transform or dft such shift transforms be most often use for symmetric data to represent different boundary symmetry and for data they correspond to different form of the discrete cosine and sine transforms another interesting choice be which be call the dft or the centered dft have the useful property that when n be a multiple of four all four of it eigenvalue see above have equal multiplicity rubio and santhanam the term gdft be also use for the phase extension of dft hence gdft method provide a generalization for constant amplitude orthogonal block transforms include linear and phase type gdft be a framework to improve time and frequency domain property of the traditional dft by the addition of the properly design phase shape function in general to the original linear phase function akansu and the discrete fourier transform can be view a a special case of the evaluate on the unit circle in the complex plane more general correspond to complex shift a and b above the ordinary dft transform a sequence or array that be a function of exactly one discrete variable n the multidimensional dft of a multidimensional array that be a function of d discrete variable for in be define by where a above and the d output index run from this be more compactly express in vector notation where we define and a d vector of index from to which we define a where the division be define a to be perform and the sum denote the set of nested summation above the inverse of the dft be analogous to the case give by a the dft express the input a a superposition of sinusoid the multidimensional dft express the input a a superposition of plane wave or multidimensional sinusoid the direction of oscillation in space be the amplitude be this decomposition be of great importance for everything from digital image processing to solve partial differential equation the solution be break up into plane wave the multidimensional dft can be compute by the composition of a sequence of dfts along each dimension in the case the independent dfts of the row along be compute first to form a new array then the independent dfts of y along the column along be compute to form the final result alternatively the column can be compute first and then the row the order be immaterial because the nested summation above commute an algorithm to compute a dft be thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional dft this approach be know a the algorithm there be also intrinsically multidimensional fft algorithm the multidimensional dft for input data consist of real number the dft output have a conjugate symmetry similar to the case above where the star again denote complex conjugation and the subscript be again interpreted modulo for the dft have see wide usage across a large number of field we only sketch a few example below see also the reference at the end all application of the dft depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete fourier transforms and their inverse a fast fourier transform spectral analysis when the dft be use for signal spectral analysis the sequence usually represent a finite set of uniformly space of some signal where represent time the conversion from continuous time to sample change the underlie fourier transform of into a fourier transform dtft which generally entail a type of distortion call aliasing choice of an appropriate see nyquist rate be the key to minimize that distortion similarly the conversion from a very long or infinite sequence to a manageable size entail a type of distortion call leakage which be manifest a a loss of detail resolution in the dtft choice of an appropriate length be the primary key to minimize that effect when the available data and time to process it be more than the amount need to attain the desired frequency resolution a standard technique be to perform multiple dfts for example to create a spectrogram if the desired result be a power spectrum and noise or randomness be present in the data average the magnitude component of the multiple dfts be a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum also call a periodogram in this context two example of such technique be the welch method and the bartlett method the general subject of estimate the power spectrum of a noisy signal be call spectral estimation a final source of distortion or perhaps illusion be the dft itself because it be just a discrete sampling of the dtft which be a function of a continuous frequency domain that can be mitigate by increase the resolution of the dft that procedure be illustrate at procedure be sometimes refer to a which be a particular implementation use in conjunction with the fast fourier transform fft algorithm the inefficiency of perform multiplication and addition with sample be more than offset by the inherent efficiency of the fft already state leakage impose a limit on the inherent resolution of the dtft so there be a practical limit to the benefit that can be obtain from a dft filter bank see and the field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operation in the frequency domain on the fourier transform for example several lossy image and sound compression method employ the discrete fourier transform the signal be cut into short segment each be transform and then the fourier coefficient of high frequency which be assume to be unnoticeable be discard the decompressor compute the inverse transform base on this reduced number of fourier coefficient compression application often use a specialized form of the dft the discrete cosine transform or sometimes the modified discrete cosine transform some relatively recent compression algorithm however use wavelet transforms which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtain by chop data into segment and transform each segment in the case of this avoid the spurious image feature that appear when image be highly compress with the original jpeg differential discrete fourier transforms be often use to solve partial differential equation where again the dft be use a an approximation for the fourier series which be recover in the limit of infinite n the advantage of this approach be that it expand the signal in complex exponential which be eigenfunctions of differentiation thus in the fourier representation differentiation be just multiply by however the choice of be not unique due to aliasing for the method to be convergent a choice similar to that in the trigonometric interpolation section above should be use a linear differential equation with constant coefficient be transform into an easily solvable algebraic equation one then use the inverse dft to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation such an approach be call a spectral method suppose we wish to compute the polynomial product c x a x b x the ordinary product expression for the coefficient of c involve a linear acyclic convolution where index do not wrap around this can be rewrite a a cyclic convolution by take the coefficient vector for a x and b x with constant term first then append zero so that the resultant coefficient vector and have dimension d deg a x deg b x then where be the vector of coefficient for c x and the convolution operator be define so but convolution become multiplication under the dft here the vector product be take elementwise thus the coefficient of the product polynomial c x be just the term deg a x deg b x of the coefficient vector with a fast fourier transform the result algorithm take o n log arithmetic operation due to it simplicity and speed the fft algorithm which be limit to composite size be often choose for the transform operation in this case d should be choose a the small integer great than the sum of the input polynomial degree that be factorizable into small prime factor and depend upon the fft implementation of large the fast known algorithm for the multiplication of very large integer use the polynomial multiplication method outline above integer can be treat a the value of a polynomial evaluate specifically at the number base with the coefficient of the polynomial corresponding to the digit in that base ex after polynomial multiplication a relatively step complete the multiplication convolution when data be convolve with a function with wide support such a for downsampling by a large sampling ratio because of the convolution theorem and the fft algorithm it may be fast to transform it multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it alternatively a good filter be obtain by simply truncate the transform data and the shorten data set dft pair note frequency shift theorem time shift theorem real dft from the geometric progression formula from the binomial theorem be a rectangular window function of w point center on n where w be an odd integer and be a function specifically be a dirichlet kernel discretization and periodic summation of the scaled gaussian function for since either or be large than one and thus warrant fast convergence of one of the two series for large you may choose to compute the frequency spectrum and convert to the time domain use the discrete fourier transform representation theory the dft can be interpret a the representation theory of the finite cyclic group in other word a sequence of complex number can be think of a an element of complex space or equivalently a function from the finite cyclic group of order to the complex number so be a class function on the finite cyclic group and thus can be express a a linear combination of the irreducible character of this group which be the root of unity from this point of view one may generalize the dft to representation theory generally or more narrowly to the representation theory of finite group more narrowly still one may generalize the dft by either change the target take value in a field other than the complex number or the domain a group other than a finite cyclic group a detail in the sequel other field many of the property of the dft only depend on the fact that be a primitive root of unity sometimes denote or so that such property include the completeness orthogonality periodicity shift convolution and unitarity property above as well a many fft algorithm for this reason the discrete fourier transform can be define by use root of unity in field other than the complex number and such generalization be commonly call transforms ntts in the case of finite field for more information see transform and discrete fourier transform general other finite group the standard dft act on a sequence x x x of complex number which can be view a a function n the multidimensional dft act on multidimensional sequence which can be view a function this suggest the generalization to fourier transforms on arbitrary finite group which act on function g where g be a finite group in this framework the standard dft be see a the fourier transform on a cyclic group while the multidimensional dft be a fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic group far fourier transform can be on cosets of a group there be various alternative to the dft for various application prominent among which be wavelets the analog of the dft be the discrete wavelet transform dwt from the point of view of analysis a key limitation of the fourier transform be that it do not include location information only frequency information and thus have difficulty in represent transient a wavelet have location as well a frequency they be well able to represent location at the expense of great difficulty represent frequency for detail see comparison of the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete fourier transform matrix matrix fourier transform of pauli matrix of transforms

combinatorics signal processing digital image processing probability theory statistic forensics option pricing cryptography numerical analysis acoustic oceanography sonar optic diffraction geometry protein structure analysis and other area this wide applicability stem from many useful property of the transforms the transforms be linear operator and with proper normalization be unitary as well a property know a parseval theorem or more generally a the plancherel theorem and most generally via pontryagin duality the transforms be usually invertible the exponential function be eigenfunctions of differentiation which mean that this representation transform linear differential equation with constant coefficient into ordinary algebraic one therefore the behavior of a linear system can be analyze at each frequency independently by the convolution theorem fourier transforms turn the complicated convolution operation into simple multiplication which mean that they provide an efficient way to compute operation such a polynomial multiplication and multiply large number the discrete version of the fourier transform see below can be evaluate quickly on computer use fast fourier

the ft method be use to decode the measure signal and record the wavelength data and by use a computer these fourier calculation be rapidly carry out so that in a matter of second a instrument can produce an infrared absorption pattern comparable to that of a prism instrument fourier transformation be also useful a a compact representation of a signal for example jpeg compression use a variant of the fourier transformation discrete cosine transform of small square piece of a digital image the fourier component of each square be round to lower arithmetic precision and weak component be eliminate entirely so that the remain component can be store very compactly in image reconstruction each image square be reassemble from the preserved approximate component which be then to produce an approximation of the original image in signal when process signal such a audio radio wave light wave seismic wave and even image fourier analysis can isolate narrowband component of a compound waveform concentrate them for easy detection or removal a large family of signal processing technique consist of a signal manipulate the data in a simple way and reverse the transformation some example include equalization of audio recording with a series of bandpass filter digital radio reception without a superheterodyne circuit a in a modern cell phone or radio scanner image processing to

transform of function of a continuous real argument and it produce a continuous function of frequency know a a frequency distribution one function be transform into another and the operation be reversible when the domain of the input initial function be time and the domain of the output final function be ordinary frequency the transform of function at frequency be give by the complex number evaluate this quantity for all value of produce the function then can be represent a a recombination of complex exponential of all possible frequency which be the inverse transform formula the complex

to a know interval of duration which be the frequency domain dual of the sampling theorem see fourier series for more information include the historical development fourier transform dtft the dtft be the mathematical dual of the fourier series thus a convergent periodic summation in the frequency domain can be represent by a fourier series whose coefficient be sample of a related continuous time function which be know a the dtft thus the of the sequence be also the transform of the modulated dirac comb function the fourier series coefficient and inverse transform be define by parameter corresponds to the sample interval and this fourier series can now be recognize a a form of the poisson summation formula thus we have the important result that when a discrete data sequence be proportional to sample of an underlie continuous function one can observe a periodic summation of the continuous fourier transform that be a cornerstone in the foundation of digital signal processing furthermore under certain idealized condition one can theoretically recover and exactly a sufficient condition for perfect recovery be that the portion of be confine to a know frequency interval of width when that interval be the applicable reconstruction formula be the interpolation formula another reason to be interested in be that it often provide insight into the amount of aliasing cause by the sample process application of the dtft be not limit to sample function see fourier transform for more information on this and other topic include normalized frequency unit windowing sequence transform property tabulate transforms of specific function fourier transform dft similar to a fourier series the dtft of a periodic sequence with period become a dirac comb function modulate by a sequence of complex coefficient see where be the sum over any sequence of length the sequence be what be customarily know a the of it be also so it be never necessary to compute more than coefficient the inverse transform be give by where be the sum over any sequence of length when be express a a periodic summation of another function and the coefficient be proportional to sample of at discrete interval of conversely when one want to compute an arbitrary number of discrete sample of one cycle of a continuous dtft it can be do by compute the relatively simple dft of as define above in most case be choose equal to the length of portion of increase know a or interpolation result in more closely spaced sample of one cycle of decrease cause overlap add in the analogous to aliasing which correspond to decimation in the frequency domain see in most case of practical interest the sequence represent a longer sequence that be truncate by the application of a window function or fir filter array the dft can be compute use a fast fourier transform fft algorithm which make it a practical and important transformation on computer see discrete fourier transform for much more information include transform property application tabulate transforms of specific function for periodic function both the fourier transform and the dtft comprise only a discrete set of frequency component fourier series and the transforms diverge at those frequency one common practice not discuss above be to handle that divergence via dirac delta and dirac comb function but the same spectral information can be discern from just one cycle of the periodic function since all the other cycle be identical similarly function can be represent a a fourier series with no actual loss of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform be a mere artifact it be common in practice for the duration of s to be limit to the period or but these formula do not require that condition transforms continuous frequency discrete frequency transform inverse transforms continuous frequency discrete frequency transform inverse when the real and imaginary part of a complex function be decompose into their even and odd part there be four component denote below by the subscript re ro ie and io and there be a mapping between the four component of a complex time function and the four component of it complex frequency transform from this various relationship be apparent for example transform of a function be the even symmetric function conversely an transform imply a transform of an function be the odd symmetric function and the converse be true transform of an function be the function and the converse be true transform of an function be the function and the converse be true transforms on arbitrary locally compact abelian topological the fourier variant can also be generalize to fourier transforms on arbitrary locally compact abelian topological group which be study in harmonic analysis there the fourier transform take function on a group to function on the dual group this treatment also allow a general formulation of the convolution theorem which relate fourier transforms and convolution see also the pontryagin duality for the generalized underpinnings of the fourier transform more specific fourier analysis can be do on cosets even discrete cosets in signal processing term a function of time be a representation of a signal with perfect time resolution but no frequency information while the fourier transform have perfect frequency resolution but no time information a alternative to the fourier transform in analysis one use transforms to represent signal in a form that have some time information and some frequency information by the uncertainty principle there be a between these these can be generalization of the fourier transform such a the fourier transform the gabor transform or fractional fourier transform frft or can use different function to represent signal a in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms with the wavelet analog of the continuous fourier transform be the continuous wavelet transform a primitive form of harmonic series date back to ancient babylonian mathematics where they be use to compute ephemerides table of astronomical position the classical greek concept of deferent and epicycle in the ptolemaic system of astronomy be relate to fourier series see deferent and epicycle mathematical formalism in modern time variant of the discrete fourier transform be use by alexis clairaut in to compute an orbit which have be describe a the first formula for the dft and in by joseph louis lagrange in compute the coefficient of a trigonometric series for a vibrate string technically clairaut work be a series a form of discrete cosine transform while lagrange work be a series a form of discrete sine transform a true dft be use by gauss in for trigonometric interpolation of asteroid orbit euler and lagrange both discretized the vibrate string problem use what would today be call sample an early modern development toward fourier analysis be the paper réflexions sur la résolution algébrique de équations by lagrange which in the method of lagrange resolvent use a complex fourier decomposition to study the solution of a cubic lagrange transform the root into the resolvent where be a cubic root of unity which be the dft of order a number of author notably jean le rond and carl friedrich gauss use trigonometric series to study the heat equation but the breakthrough development be the paper mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corp solides by joseph fourier whose crucial insight be to model all function by trigonometric series introduce the fourier series historian be divide a to how much to credit lagrange and others for the development of fourier theory daniel bernoulli and leonhard euler have introduce trigonometric representation of function and lagrange have give the fourier series solution to the wave equation so fourier contribution be mainly the bold claim that an arbitrary function could be represent by a fourier series the subsequent development of the field be know a harmonic analysis and be also an early instance of representation theory the first fast fourier transform fft algorithm for the dft be discover around by carl friedrich gauss when interpolate measurement of the orbit of the asteroid juno and pallas although that particular fft algorithm be more often attribute to it modern rediscoverers cooley and tukey in signal process the fourier transform often take a time series or a function of continuous time and map it into a frequency spectrum that be it take a function from the time domain into the frequency

summary of aerobic respiration glycolysis from glycose an old term for glucose degradation be the metabolic pathway that convert glucose into pyruvate pyruvic acid and a hydrogen ion the free energy release in this process be use to form the molecule atp adenosine triphosphate and nadh reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycolysis be a sequence of ten reaction most monosaccharide such a fructose and galactose can be convert to one of these intermediate the intermediate may also be directly useful rather than just utilize a step in the overall reaction for example the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap be a source of the glycerol that combine with fatty acid to form fat glycolysis be an metabolic pathway the wide occurrence of glycolysis indicate that it be an ancient metabolic pathway indeed the reaction that constitute glycolysis and it parallel pathway the pentose phosphate pathway occur under the condition of the archean ocean also in the absence of enzyme in most organisms glycolysis occur in the cytosol the most common type of glycolysis be the emp pathway which be discover by gustav embden otto meyerhof and jakub karol parnas glycolysis also refers to other pathway such a the pathway and various heterofermentative and homofermentative pathway however the discussion here will be limit to the pathway the glycolysis pathway can be separate into two phase the preparatory or investment phase wherein atp be consume the pay off phase wherein atp be produce the overall reaction of glycolysis be the use of symbol in this equation make it appear unbalanced with respect to oxygen atom hydrogen atom and charge atom balance be maintain by the two phosphate pi group each exists in the form of a hydrogen phosphate anion dissociate to contribute overall each liberate an oxygen atom when it bind to an adp adenosine diphosphate molecule contribute o overall charge be balance by the difference between adp and atp in the cellular environment all three hydroxyl group of adp dissociate into and give and this ion tend to exist in an ionic bond with give atp behaves identically except that it have four hydroxyl group give when these difference along with the true charge on the two phosphate group be consider together the net charge of on each side be balance for simple fermentation the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecule of pyruvate have a net yield of two molecule of atp most cell will then carry out further reaction to the use and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid many bacteria use inorganic compound a hydrogen acceptor to regenerate the cell perform aerobic respiration synthesize much more atp but not a part of glycolysis these further aerobic reaction use pyruvate and nadh from glycolysis eukaryotic aerobic respiration produce approximately additional molecule of atp for each glucose molecule however most of these be produce by a mechanism vastly different than the phosphorylation in glycolysis the production per glucose of anaerobic respiration relative to aerobic respiration result in great flux through the pathway under hypoxic condition unless alternative source of anaerobically oxidizable substrate such a fatty acid be find metabolism of common monosaccharide include glycolysis gluconeogenesis glycogenesis and glycogenolysis the pathway of glycolysis a it be know today take almost year to fully discover the combined result of many small experiment be require in order to understand the pathway a a whole the first step in understand glycolysis begin in the nineteenth century with the wine industry for economic reason the french wine industry seek to investigate why wine sometimes turn distasteful instead of ferment into alcohol french scientist louis pasteur research this issue during the and the result of his experiment begin the long road to elucidate the pathway of glycolysis his experiment show that fermentation occurs by the action of living microorganism and that yeast glucose consumption decrease under aerobic condition of fermentation in comparison to anaerobic condition the pasteur effect eduard buchner discover fermentation insight into the component step of glycolysis be provide by the fermentation experiment of eduard buchner during the buchner demonstrate that the conversion of glucose to ethanol be possible use a extract of yeast due to the action of enzyme in the extract this experiment not only revolutionized biochemistry but also allow later scientist to analyze this pathway in a more controlled lab setting in a series of experiment scientist arthur harden and william young discover more piece of glycolysis they discover the regulatory effect of atp on glucose consumption during alcohol fermentation they also shed light on the role of one compound a a glycolysis intermediate fructose the elucidation of fructose be accomplish by measure level when yeast juice be incubate with glucose production increase rapidly then slow down harden and young note that this process would restart if an inorganic phosphate pi be add to the mixture harden and young deduce that this process produce organic phosphate ester and further experiment allow them to extract fructose diphosphate arthur harden and william young along with nick sheppard determine in a second experiment that a subcellular fraction the enzyme and a cytoplasm fraction adp atp and and other cofactor be require together for fermentation to proceed this experiment begin by observe that dialyze purify yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate this mixture be rescue with the addition of undialyzed yeast extract that have be boil boil the yeast extract render all protein inactive a it denature them the ability of boil extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggest that the cofactor be in character otto meyerhof one of the main scientist involve in complete the puzzle of glycolysis in the otto meyerhof be able to link together some of the many individual piece of glycolysis discover by buchner harden and young meyerhof and his team be able to extract different glycolytic enzyme from muscle tissue and combine them to artificially create the pathway from glycogen to lactic acid in one paper meyerhof and scientist renate investigate the reaction that split fructose into the two triose phosphate previous work propose that the split occur via plus an oxidizing enzyme and cozymase meyerhoff and junowicz find that the equilibrium constant for the isomerase and aldose reaction be not affect by inorganic phosphate or any other cozymase or oxidize enzyme they further remove diphosphoglyceraldehyde a a possible intermediate in glycolysis with all of these piece available by the gustav embden propose a detailed outline of that pathway we now know a glycolysis the big difficulty in determine the intricacy of the pathway be due to the very short lifetime and low concentration of the intermediate of the fast glycolytic reaction by the meyerhof embden and many other biochemist have finally complete the puzzle of glycolysis the understanding of the isolated pathway have be expand in the subsequent decade to include further detail of it regulation and integration with other metabolic pathway of the first five step of glycolysis be regard a the preparatory or investment phase since they consume energy to convert the glucose into two sugar phosphates the first step be phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzyme call hexokinases to form glucose this reaction consume atp but it act to keep the glucose concentration low promote continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporter in addition it block the glucose from leak out the cell lack transporter for and free diffusion out of the cell be prevent due to the charge nature of glucose may alternatively be form from the phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen in animal an isozyme of hexokinase call glucokinase be also use in the liver which have a much low affinity for glucose km in the vicinity of normal glycemia and differs in regulatory property the different substrate affinity and alternate regulation of this enzyme be a reflection of the role of the liver in maintain blood sugar level be then rearrange into fructose by glucose phosphate isomerase fructose can also enter the glycolytic pathway by phosphorylation at this point the change in structure be an isomerization in which the have be convert to the reaction require an enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase to proceed this reaction be freely reversible under normal cell condition however it be often drive forward because of a low concentration of which be constantly consume during the next step of glycolysis under condition of high concentration this reaction readily run in reverse this phenomenon can be explain through le chatelier principle isomerization to a keto sugar be necessary for carbanion stabilization in the fourth reaction step below the energy expenditure of another atp in this step be justify in way the glycolytic process up to this step become irreversible and the energy supply destabilize the molecule because the reaction catalyze by phosphofructokinase be couple to the hydrolysis of atp an energetically favorable step it be in essence irreversible and a different pathway must be use to do the reverse conversion during gluconeogenesis this make the reaction a key regulatory point see below this be also the step furthermore the second phosphorylation event be necessary to allow the formation of two charge group rather than only one in the subsequent step of glycolysis ensure the prevention of free diffusion of substrate out of the cell the same reaction can also be catalyze by phosphofructokinase or which be find in most plant some bacteria archea and protist but not in animal this enzyme use pyrophosphate ppi a a phosphate donor instead of atp it be a reversible reaction increase the flexibility of glycolytic metabolism a rarer pfk enzyme variant have be identify in archaean specie destabilize the molecule in the previous reaction allow the hexose ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugar dihydroxyacetone phosphate a ketose and glyceraldehyde an aldose there be two class of aldolases class i aldolases present in animal and plant and class ii aldolases present in fungi and bacteria the two class use different mechanism in cleave the ketose ring electron delocalize in the bond cleavage associate with the alcohol group the result carbanion be stabilize by the structure of the carbanion itself via resonance charge distribution and by the presence of a charge ion prosthetic group triosephosphate isomerase rapidly interconverts dihydroxyacetone phosphate with glyceraldehyde that proceed far into glycolysis this be advantageous a it direct dihydroxyacetone phosphate down the same pathway a glyceraldehyde simplify regulation the second half of glycolysis be know a the phase characterise by a net gain of the molecule atp and nadh since glucose lead to two triose sugar in the preparatory phase each reaction in the phase occur twice per glucose molecule this yield nadh molecule and atp molecule lead to a net gain of nadh molecule and atp molecule from the glycolytic pathway per glucose the aldehyde group of the triose sugar be oxidise and inorganic phosphate be add to them form the hydrogen be use to reduce two molecule of a hydrogen carrier to give nadh for each triose hydrogen atom balance and charge balance be both maintain because the phosphate pi group actually exist in the form of a hydrogen phosphate anion which dissociate to contribute the extra ion and give a net charge of on both side here arsenate an anion akin to inorganic phosphate may replace phosphate a a substrate to form this however be unstable and readily hydrolyze to form the intermediate in the next step of the pathway a a consequence of bypass this step the molecule of atp generate from bisphosphoglycerate in the next reaction will not be make even though the reaction proceeds a a result arsenate be an uncoupler of glycolysis this step be the enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from to adp by phosphoglycerate kinase form atp and at this step glycolysis have reach the point molecule of atp be consume and new molecule have now be synthesize this step one of the two phosphorylation step require adp thus when the cell have plenty of atp and little adp this reaction do not occur because atp decay relatively quickly when it be not metabolize this be an important regulatory point in the glycolytic pathway adp actually exist a and atp a balance the charge at both side phosphoglycerate mutase isomerises into enolase next convert to phosphoenolpyruvate this reaction be an elimination reaction involve an mechanism one conformational ion to coordinate with the carboxylate group of the substrate and one catalytic ion that participate in the dehydration a final phosphorylation now form a molecule of pyruvate and a molecule of atp by mean of the enzyme pyruvate kinase this serve a an additional regulatory step similar to the phosphoglycerate kinase step biochemical logic the existence of more than one point of regulation indicate that intermediate between those point enter and leave the glycolysis pathway by other process for example in the first regulated step hexokinase convert glucose into instead of continue through the glycolysis pathway this intermediate can be convert into glucose storage molecule such a glycogen or starch the reverse reaction break down glycogen produce mainly very little free glucose be form in the reaction the so produce can enter glycolysis after the first control point in the second regulated step the third step of glycolysis phosphofructokinase convert into which then be convert into and dihydroxyacetone phosphate the dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be remove from glycolysis by conversion into which can be use to form triglyceride conversely triglyceride can be break down into fatty acid and glycerol the latter in turn can be convert into dihydroxyacetone phosphate which can enter glycolysis after the second control point free energy change of metabolite in erythrocyte compound concentration m m glucose dihydroxyacetone phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate atp adp pi the change in free energy δ g for each step in the glycolysis pathway can be calculate use δ g δ g rt ln q where q be the reaction quotient this require know the concentration of the metabolite all of these value be available for erythrocyte with the exception of the concentration of and nadh the ratio of to nadh in the cytoplasm be approximately which make the oxidation of step more favourable use the measured concentration of each step and the standard free energy change the actual free energy change can be calculate neglect this be very common the delta g of atp hydrolysis in cell be not the standard free energy change of atp hydrolysis quote in textbook in free energy for each step of glycolysis step reaction δ g δ g glucose dihydroxyacetone dihydroxyacetone nadh from measure the physiological concentration of metabolite in an erythrocyte it seem that about seven of the step in glycolysis be in equilibrium for that cell type three of the step the one with large negative free energy change be not in equilibrium and be refer to a irreversible such step be often subject to regulation step in the figure be show behind the other step because that step be a that can decrease or increase the concentration of the intermediate that compound be convert to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase which be a catalytically perfect enzyme it rate be so fast that the reaction can be assume to be in equilibrium the fact that δ g be not zero indicate that the actual concentration in the erythrocyte be not accurately know regulation of the rate limit enzyme the four regulatory enzyme be hexokinase or glucokinase in the liver phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase the flux through the glycolytic pathway be adjust in response to condition both inside and outside the cell the internal factor that regulate glycolysis do so primarily to provide atp in adequate quantity for the need the external factor act primarily on the liver fat tissue and muscle which can remove large quantity of glucose from the blood after meal thus prevent hyperglycemia by store the excess glucose a fat or glycogen depend on the tissue type the liver be also capable of release glucose into the blood between meal during fasting and exercise thus prevent hypoglycemia by mean of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis these latter reaction coincide with the halting of glycolysis in the liver in animal regulation of blood glucose level by the pancreas in conjunction with the liver be a vital part of homeostasis the beta cell in the pancreatic islet be sensitive to the blood glucose concentration a rise in the blood glucose concentration cause them to release insulin into the blood which have an effect particularly on the liver but also on fat and muscle cell cause these tissue to remove glucose from the blood when the blood sugar fall the pancreatic beta cell cease insulin production but instead stimulate the neighboring pancreatic alpha cell to release glucagon into the blood this in turn cause the liver to release glucose into the blood by break down store glycogen and by mean of gluconeogenesis if the fall in the blood glucose level be particularly rapid or severe other glucose sensor cause the release of epinephrine from the adrenal gland into the blood this have the same action a glucagon on glucose metabolism but it effect be more pronounced in the liver glucagon and epinephrine cause the phosphorylation of the key rate limit enzyme of glycolysis fatty acid synthesis cholesterol synthesis gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis insulin have the opposite effect on these enzyme the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these enzyme ultimately in response to the glucose level in the blood be the dominant manner by which these pathway be control in the liver fat and muscle cell thus the phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase inhibits glycolysis whereas it dephosphorylation through the action of insulin stimulates glycolysis in addition hexokinase and glucokinase act independently of the hormonal effect a control at the entry point of glucose into the cell of different tissue hexokinase responds to the level in the cell or in the case of glucokinase to the blood sugar level in the blood to impart entirely intracellular control of the glycolytic pathway in different tissue see below when glucose have be convert into by hexokinase or glucokinase it can either be convert to for conversion to glycogen or it be alternatively convert by glycolysis to pyruvate which enter the mitochondrion where it be convert into and then into citrate excess citrate be export from the mitochondrion back into the cytosol where atp citrate lyase regenerates and oxaloacetate oaa the be then use for fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis two important way of utilize excess glucose when it concentration be high in blood the rate limit enzyme catalyze these reaction perform these function when they have be dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the liver cell between meal during fast exercise or hypoglycemia glucagon and epinephrine be release into the blood this cause liver glycogen to be convert back to and then convert to glucose by the enzyme glucose and release into the blood glucagon and epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis which coverts substrate into which join the derive from glycogen or substitute for it when the liver glycogen store have be deplete this be critical for brain function since the brain utilizes glucose a an energy source under most condition the simultaneously phosphorylation of particularly phosphofructokinase but also to a certain extent pyruvate kinase prevent glycolysis occur at the same time a gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis hexokinase and yeast hexokinase b all cell contain the enzyme hexokinase which catalyze the conversion of glucose that have enter the cell into since the cell membrane be impervious to hexokinase essentially act to transport glucose into the cell from which it can then no longer escape hexokinase be inhibit by high level of in the cell thus the rate of entry of glucose into cell partially depend on how fast can be dispose of by glycolysis and by glycogen synthesis in the cell which store glycogen namely liver and muscle glucokinase unlike hexokinase be not inhibit by it occur in liver cell and will only phosphorylate the glucose enter the cell to form when the sugar in the blood be abundant this be the first step in the glycolytic pathway in the liver it therefore imparts an additional layer of control of the glycolytic pathway in this organ phosphofructokinase bacillus stearothermophilus phosphofructokinase phosphofructokinase be an important control point in the glycolytic pathway since it be one of the irreversible step and have key allosteric effector amp and fructose fructose be a very potent activator of phosphofructokinase that be synthesize when be phosphorylated by a second phosphofructokinase in the liver when blood sugar be low and glucagon elevates camp be phosphorylated by protein kinase a the phosphorylation inactivates and another domain on this protein become active a fructose which convert back to both glucagon and epinephrine cause high level of camp in the liver the result of low level of liver be a decrease in activity of phosphofructokinase and an increase in activity of fructose so that gluconeogenesis in essence glycolysis in reverse be favor this be consistent with the role of the liver in such situation since the response of the liver to these hormone be to release glucose to the blood atp compete with amp for the allosteric effector site on the pfk enzyme atp concentration in cell be much high than those of amp typically high but the concentration of atp do not change more than about under physiological condition whereas a drop in atp result in a increase in amp thus the relevance of atp a an allosteric effector be questionable an increase in amp be a consequence of a decrease in energy charge in the cell citrate inhibits phosphofructokinase when test in vitro by enhance the inhibitory effect of atp however it be doubtful that this be a meaningful effect in vivo because citrate in the cytosol be utilized mainly for conversion to for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis tigar a induced enzyme be responsible for the regulation of phosphofructokinase and act to protect against oxidative stress tigar be a single enzyme with dual function that regulate it can behave a a phosphatase which cleave the phosphate at produce it can also behave a a kinase add a phosphate onto of which produce in human the tigar protein be encode by gene the tigar enzyme will hinder the forward progression of glycolysis by create a build up of which be isomerize into the accumulation of will shunt carbon into the pentose phosphate pathway pyruvate kinase yeast pyruvate kinase pyruvate kinase enzyme catalyze the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate and atp be form pyruvate kinase catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate pep to adp yield one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of atp liver pyruvate kinase be indirectly regulate by epinephrine and glucagon through protein kinase a this protein kinase phosphorylates liver pyruvate kinase to deactivate it muscle pyruvate kinase be not inhibit by epinephrine activation of protein kinase glucagon signal fast no glucose available thus glycolysis be inhibit in the liver but unaffected in muscle when fast an increase in blood sugar lead to secretion of insulin which activate phosphoprotein phosphatase i lead to dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate kinase these control prevent pyruvate kinase from be active at the same time a the enzyme that catalyze the reverse reaction pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase prevent a futile cycle the overall process of glycolysis be glucose adp pi pyruvate nadh atp if glycolysis be to continue indefinitely all of the would be use up and glycolysis would stop to allow glycolysis to continue organism must be able to oxidize nadh back to how this be perform depends on which external electron acceptor be available anoxic regeneration of one method of do this be to simply have the pyruvate do the oxidation in this process pyruvate be convert to lactate the conjugate base of lactic acid in a process call lactic acid fermentation pyruvate nadh lactate this process occur in the bacteria involve in make yogurt the lactic acid cause the milk to curdle this process also occur in animal under hypoxic or partially anaerobic condition find for example in overworked muscle that be starve of oxygen in many tissue this be a cellular last resort for energy most animal tissue can not tolerate anaerobic condition for an extended period of time some organism such a yeast convert nadh back to in a process call ethanol fermentation in this process the pyruvate be convert first to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide and then to ethanol lactic acid fermentation and ethanol fermentation can occur in the absence of oxygen this anaerobic fermentation allow many organism to use glycolysis a their only energy source anoxic regeneration of be only an effective mean of energy production during short intense exercise in vertebrate for a period range from second to minute during a maximal effort in human at low exercise intensity it can sustain muscle activity in dive animal such a seal whale and other aquatic vertebrate for very much long period of time under these condition be replenish by nadh donate it electron to pyruvate to form lactate this produce atp molecule per glucose molecule or about of glucose energy potential atp molecule in bacteria but the speed at which atp be produce in this manner be about time that of oxidative phosphorylation the ph in the cytoplasm quickly drop when hydrogen ion accumulate in the muscle eventually inhibit the enzyme involve in glycolysis the burn sensation in muscle during hard exercise can be attribute to the release of hydrogen ion during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demand of the muscle these hydrogen ion form a part of lactic acid the body fall back on this less efficient but faster method of produce atp under low oxygen condition this be think to have be the primary mean of energy production in early organism before oxygen reach high concentration in the atmosphere between and million year ago and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of in cell the liver in mammal get rid of this excess lactate by transform it back into pyruvate under aerobic condition see cori cycle fermentation of pyruvate to lactate be sometimes also call anaerobic glycolysis however glycolysis end with the production of pyruvate regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen in the above two example of fermentation nadh be oxidize by transfer two electron to pyruvate however anaerobic bacteria use a wide variety of compound a the terminal electron acceptor in cellular respiration nitrogenous compound such a nitrate and nitrite sulfur compound such a sulfate sulfites sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur carbon dioxide iron compound manganese compound cobalt compound and uranium compound aerobic regeneration of and disposal of in aerobic organism a complex mechanism have be develop to use the oxygen in air a the final electron acceptor firstly the nadh generate by glycolysis have to be transfer to the mitochondrion to be oxidize and thus to regenerate the necessary for glycolysis to continue however the inner mitochondrial membrane be impermeable to nadh and use be therefore make of two to transport the electron from nadh across the mitochondrial membrane they be the shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle in the former the electron from nadh be transfer to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate the malate then traverse the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it be reoxidized by form oxaloacetate and nadh the oxaloacetate be then to the cytosol via it conversion to aspartate which be readily transport out of the mitochondrion in the glycerol phosphate shuttle electron from cytosolic nadh be transfer to dihydroxyacetone to form which readily traverse the outer mitochondrial membrane be then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone donate it electron to fad instead of this reaction take place on the inner mitochondrial membrane allow to donate it electron directly to coenzyme q ubiquinone which be part of the electron transport chain which ultimately transfer electron to molecular oxygen with the formation of water and the release of energy eventually capture in the form of atp the glycolytic pyruvate plus be convert to and nadh within the mitochondrion in a process call pyruvate decarboxylation the result enters the citric acid cycle or krebs cycle where the acetyl group of the be convert into carbon dioxide by two decarboxylation reaction with the formation of yet more nadh the nadh be oxidize to by the electron transport chain use oxygen a the final electron acceptor to form water the energy release during this process be use to create a hydrogen ion or proton gradient across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion finally the proton gradient be use to produce about atp for every nadh oxidize in a process call oxidative phosphorylation of carbohydrate into fatty acid and the pyruvate produce by glycolysis be an important intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrate into fatty acid and cholesterol this occur via the conversion of pyruvate into in the mitochondrion however this acetyl coa need to be transport into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol occur this can not occur directly to obtain cytosolic citrate produce by the condensation of acetyl coa with oxaloacetate be remove from the citric acid cycle and carry across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol there it be cleave by atp citrate lyase into and oxaloacetate the oxaloacetate be return to mitochondrion a malate and then back into oxaloacetate to transfer more out of the mitochondrion the cytosolic can be carboxylate by carboxylase into malonyl coa the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acid or it can be combine with to form which be the rate limit step control the synthesis of cholesterol cholesterol can be use as be a a structural component of cellular membrane or it can be use to synthesize the steroid hormone bile salt and vitamin of pyruvate into oxaloacetate for the citric acid pyruvate molecule produce by glycolysis be actively transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane and into the matrix where they can either be oxidize and combine with coenzyme a to form and nadh or they can be carboxylate by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate this latter reaction fill up the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle and be therefore an anaplerotic reaction from the greek meaning to fill up increase the capacity to metabolize when the tissue energy need in heart and skeletal muscle be suddenly increase by activity in the citric acid cycle all the intermediate citrate succinate fumarate malate and oxaloacetate be regenerate during each turn of the cycle add more of any of these intermediate to the mitochondrion therefore mean that that additional amount be retain within the cycle increase all the other intermediate a one be convert into the other hence the addition of oxaloacetate greatly increase the amount of all the citric acid intermediate thereby increase the cycle capacity to metabolize acetyl coa convert it acetate component into and water with the release of enough energy to form atp and gtp molecule for each additional molecule of acetyl coa that combine with oxaloacetate in the cycle to cataplerotically remove oxaloacetate from the citric cycle malate can be transport from the mitochondrion into the cytoplasm decrease the amount of oxaloacetate that can be regenerate furthermore citric acid intermediate be constantly use to form a variety of substance such a the purine pyrimidine and porphyrins this article concentrate on the catabolic role of glycolysis with regard to convert potential chemical energy to usable chemical energy during the oxidation of glucose to pyruvate many of the metabolite in the glycolytic pathway be also use by anabolic pathway and a a consequence flux through the pathway be critical to maintain a supply of carbon skeleton for biosynthesis the follow metabolic pathway be all strongly reliant on glycolysis a a source of metabolite and many more pentose phosphate pathway which begin with the dehydrogenation of the first intermediate to be produce by glycolysis produce various pentose sugar and nadph for the synthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol glycogen synthesis also start with at the beginning of the glycolytic pathway glycerol for the formation of triglyceride and phospholipid be produce from the glycolytic intermediate various pathway fatty acid synthesis cholesterol synthesis the citric acid cycle which in turn lead to acid synthesis synthesis synthesis although gluconeogenesis and glycolysis share many intermediate the one be not functionally a branch or tributary of the other there be two regulatory step in both pathway which when active in the one pathway be automatically inactive in the other the two process can therefore not be simultaneously active indeed if both set of reaction be highly active at the same time the net result would be the hydrolysis of four high energy phosphate bond two atp and two gtp per reaction cycle be the oxidize agent in glycolysis a it be in most other energy yield metabolic reaction of fatty acid and during the citric acid cycle the nadh thus produce be primarily use to ultimately transfer electron to to produce water or when be not available to produce compound such a lactate or ethanol see anoxic regeneration of above nadh be rarely use for synthetic process the notable exception be gluconeogenesis during fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis the reducing agent be nadph this difference exemplify a general principle that nadph be consume during biosynthetic reaction whereas nadh be generate in reaction the source of the nadph be when malate be oxidatively decarboxylate by malic enzyme pyruvate and nadph be form nadph be also form by the pentose phosphate pathway which convert glucose into ribose which can be use in synthesis of nucleotide and nucleic acid or it can be catabolize to pyruvate diabetes cellular uptake of glucose occurs in response to insulin signal and glucose be subsequently break down through glycolysis lower blood sugar level however the low insulin level see in diabetes result in hyperglycemia where glucose level in the blood rise and glucose be not properly take up by cell hepatocytes far contribute to this hyperglycemia through gluconeogenesis glycolysis in hepatocytes control hepatic glucose production and when glucose be overproduce by the liver without have a mean of be break down by the body hyperglycemia result genetic disease glycolytic mutation be generally rare due to importance of the metabolic pathway this mean that the majority of occur mutation result in an inability for the cell to respire and therefore cause the death of the cell at an early stage however some mutation be see with one notable example be pyruvate kinase deficiency lead to chronic hemolytic anemia cancer malignant tumor cell perform glycolysis at a rate that be ten time faster than their noncancerous tissue counterpart during their genesis limit capillary support often result in hypoxia decrease supply within the tumor cell thus these cell rely on anaerobic metabolic process such a glycolysis for atp adenosine triphosphate some tumor cell overexpress specific glycolytic enzyme which result in high rate of glycolysis often these enzyme be isoenzymes of traditional glycolysis enzyme that vary in their susceptibility to traditional feedback inhibition the increase in glycolytic activity ultimately counteract the effect of hypoxia by generate sufficient atp from this anaerobic pathway this phenomenon be first describe in by otto warburg and be refer to a the warburg effect the warburg hypothesis claim that cancer be primarily cause by dysfunctionality in mitochondrial metabolism rather than because of the uncontrolled growth of cell a number of theory have be advance to explain the warburg effect one such theory suggest that the increased glycolysis be a normal protective process of the body and that malignant change could be primarily cause by energy metabolism this high glycolysis rate have important medical application a high aerobic glycolysis by malignant tumor be utilized clinically to diagnose and monitor treatment response of cancer by image uptake of fdg a radioactive modified hexokinase substrate with positron emission tomography pet there be ongoing research to affect mitochondrial metabolism and treat cancer by reduce glycolysis and thus starve cancerous cell in various new way include a ketogenic diet some of the metabolite in glycolysis have alternative name and nomenclature in part this be because some of them be common to other pathway such a the calvin cycle this article alternative name alternative

in mathematics a group pronounce lee be a group whose element be organize continuously and smoothly a oppose to discrete group where the element be make lie group differentiable manifold lie group be name after norwegian mathematician sophus lie who lay the foundation of the theory of continuous transformation group in rough term a lie group be a group it be a group whose element be describe by several real parameter a such lie group provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry such a rotational symmetry in three dimension lie group be widely use in many part of modern mathematics and physic lie original motivation for introduce lie group be to model the continuous symmetry of differential equation in much the same way that finite group be use in galois theory to model the discrete symmetry of algebraic equation the set of all complex number with absolute value correspond to point on the circle of center and radius in the complex plane be a lie group under complex multiplication the circle group lie group be smooth differentiable manifold and a such can be study use differential calculus in contrast with the case of more general topological group one of the key idea in the theory of lie group be to replace the global object the group with it local or linearize version which lie himself call it infinitesimal group and which have since become know a it lie algebra lie group play an enormous role in modern geometry on several different level felix klein argue in his erlangen program that one can consider various geometry by specify an appropriate transformation group that leave certain geometric property invariant thus euclidean geometry corresponds to the choice of the group e of transformation of the euclidean space conformal geometry corresponds to enlarge the group to the conformal group whereas in projective geometry one be interested in the property invariant under the projective group this idea later lead to the notion of a where g be a lie group of local symmetry of a manifold lie group and their associate lie algebra play a major role in modern physic with the lie group typically play the role of a symmetry of a physical system here the representation of the lie group or of it lie algebra be especially important representation theory be use extensively in particle physic group whose representation be of particular importance include the rotation group so or it double cover su the special unitary group su and the poincaré group on a global level whenever a lie group act on a geometric object such a a riemannian or a symplectic manifold this action provide a measure of rigidity and yield a rich algebraic structure the presence of continuous symmetry express via a lie group action on a manifold place strong constraint on it geometry and facilitate analysis on the manifold linear action of lie group be especially important and be study in representation theory in the elli kolchin armand borel and claude chevalley realise that many foundational result concern lie group can be develop completely algebraically give rise to the theory of algebraic group define over an arbitrary field this insight open new possibility in pure algebra by provide a uniform construction for most finite simple group as well a in algebraic geometry the theory of automorphic form an important branch of modern number theory deal extensively with analogue of lie group over adele ring p lie group play an important role via their connection with galois representation in number theory a lie group be a group that be also a real smooth manifold in which the group operation of multiplication and inversion be smooth map smoothness of the group multiplication mean that μ be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into g these two requirement can be combine to the single requirement that the mapping be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into g first examples the real invertible matrix form a group under multiplication denote by or by this be a noncompact real lie group it be an open subset of this group be disconnect it have two connect component correspond to the positive and negative value of the determinant the rotation matrix form a subgroup of denote by it be a lie group in it own right specifically a compact connected lie group which be diffeomorphic to the circle use the rotation angle a a parameter this group can be parametrized a follow addition of the angle correspond to multiplication of the element of and take the opposite angle corresponds to inversion thus both multiplication and inversion be differentiable map the affine group of one dimension be a matrix lie group consist of real matrix with the first diagonal entry be positive and the second diagonal entry be thus the group consist of matrix of the form we now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of element that be not a lie group under a certain topology the group give by with a fixed irrational number be a subgroup of the torus that be not a lie group when give the subspace topology if we take any small neighborhood of a point in for example the portion of in be disconnect the group wind repeatedly around the torus without ever reach a previous point of the spiral and thus form a dense subgroup of a portion of the group inside small neighborhood of the element be disconnect in the subset topology on the group can however be give a different topology in which the distance between two point be define a the length of the short path in the group join to in this topology be identify homeomorphically with the real line by identify each element with the number in the definition of with this topology be just the group of real number under addition and be therefore a lie group the group be an example of a lie subgroup of a lie group that be not close see the discussion below of lie subgroup in the section on basic concept lie let denote the group of invertible matrix with entry in any closed subgroup of be a lie group lie group of this sort be call lie group since most of the interesting example of lie group can be realize a matrix lie group some textbook restrict attention to this class include those of hall and rossmann restrict attention to matrix lie group simplify the definition of the lie algebra and the exponential map the follow be standard example of matrix lie group special linear group over and and consist of matrix with determinant one and entries in or unitary group and special unitary group u n and su n consisting of complex matrix satisfy and also in the case of su n orthogonal group and special orthogonal group o n and so n consisting of real matrix satisfy and also in the case of so n all of the precede example fall under the heading of the classical group related concept a lie group be define in the same way use complex manifold rather than real one example and similarly use an alternate metric completion of one can define a p lie group over the p number a topological group in which each point have a p neighborhood hilbert fifth problem ask whether replace differentiable manifold with topological or analytic one can yield new example the answer to this question turn out to be negative in gleason montgomery and zippin show that if g be a topological manifold with continuous group operation then there exist exactly one analytic structure on g which turn it into a lie group see also conjecture if the underlie manifold be allow to be for example a hilbert manifold then one arrive at the notion of an lie group it be possible to define analogue of many lie group over finite field and these give most of the example of finite simple group the language of category theory provide a concise definition for lie group a lie group be a group object in the category of smooth manifold this be important because it allow generalization of the notion of a lie group to lie supergroups topological definition a lie group can be define a a hausdorff topological group that near the identity element look like a transformation group with no reference to differentiable manifold first we define an linear lie group to be a subgroup g of the general linear group such that for some neighborhood v of the identity element e in g the topology on v be the subspace topology of and v be close in g have at most countably many connected component for example a closed subgroup of that be a matrix lie group satisfy the above condition then a lie group be define a a topological group that be locally isomorphic near the identity to an immersely linear lie group and have at most countably many connected component show the topological definition be equivalent to the usual one be technical and the beginning reader should skip the following but be do roughly a follow give a lie group g in the usual manifold sense the lie algebra correspondence or a version of lie third theorem construct an immersed lie subgroup such that share the same lie algebra thus they be locally isomorphic hence g satisfy the above topological definition conversely let g be a topological group that be a lie group in the above topological sense and choose an immersely linear lie group that be locally isomorphic to g then by a version of the closed subgroup theorem be a manifold and then through the local isomorphism g acquire a structure of a manifold near the identity element one then show that the group law on g can be give by formal power series so the group operation be and g itself be a manifold the topological definition imply the statement that if two lie group be isomorphic a topological group then they be isomorphic a lie group in fact it state the general principle that to a large extent the topology of a lie group together with the group law determine the geometry of the group lie group occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physic matrix group or algebraic group be roughly group of matrix for example orthogonal and symplectic group and these give most of the more common example of lie group one and the only connected lie group with dimension one be the real line with the group operation be addition and the circle group of complex number with absolute value one with the group operation be multiplication the group be often denote a the group of unitary matrix in two dimension if we restrict attention to simply connected group then they be classify by their lie algebra there be up to isomorphism only two lie algebra of dimension two the associate simply connect lie group be with the group operation be vector addition and the affine group in dimension one described in the previous subsection under first example additional example group su be the group of unitary matrix with determinant topologically su be the a a group it may be identify with the group of unit quaternion heisenberg group be a connected nilpotent lie group of dimension play a key role in quantum mechanic lorentz group be a lie group of linear isometry of the minkowski space poincaré group be a lie group of affine isometry of the minkowski space exceptional lie group of type g f e e e have dimension and along with the series of simple lie group the exceptional group complete the list of simple lie group symplectic group sp n consists of all n n matrix preserve a symplectic form on n it be a connected lie group of dimension n n construction there be several standard way to form new lie group from old one product of two lie group be a lie group topologically close subgroup of a lie group be a lie group this be know a the closed subgroup theorem or theorem quotient of a lie group by a closed normal subgroup be a lie group universal cover of a connected lie group be a lie group for example the group be the universal cover of the circle group in fact any covering of a differentiable manifold be also a differentiable manifold but by specify universal cover one guarantee a group structure compatible with it other structure relate notion some example of group that be not lie group except in the trivial sense that any group have at most countably many element can be view a a lie group with the discrete topology be group such a the additive group of an real vector space these be not lie group a they be not manifold totally disconnected group such a the galois group of an infinite extension of field or the additive group of the p number these be not lie group because their underlying space be not real manifold some of these group be lie group in general only topological group have similar local property to n for some positive integer n can be lie group of course they must also have a differentiable structure the lie algebra associate with a lie group to every lie group we can associate a lie algebra whose underlying vector space be the tangent space of the lie group at the identity element and which completely capture the local structure of the group informally we can think of element of the lie algebra a element of the group that be infinitesimally close to the identity and the lie bracket of the lie algebra be relate to the commutator of two such infinitesimal element before give the abstract definition we give a few examples the lie algebra of the vector space n be just n with the lie bracket give by a in general the lie bracket of a connected lie group be always if and only if the lie group be abelian the lie algebra of the general linear group gl n of invertible matrix be the vector space m n of square matrix with the lie bracket give by a ab g be a closed subgroup of gl n then the lie algebra of g can be think of informally a the matrix m of m n such that ε m be in g where ε be an infinitesimal positive number with of course no such real number ε exist for example the orthogonal group o n consists of matrix a with aa t so the lie algebra consist of the matrix m with ε m ε m t which be equivalent to m t because precede description can be make more rigorous a follow the lie algebra of a closed subgroup g of gl n may be compute a where exp tx be define use the matrix exponential it can then be show that the lie algebra of g be a real vector space that be close under the bracket operation the concrete definition give above for matrix group be easy to work with but have some minor problem to use it we first need to represent a lie group a a group of matrix but not all lie group can be represent in this way and even it be not obvious that the lie algebra be independent of the representation we use to get around these problem we give the general definition of the lie algebra of a lie group in step vector field on any smooth manifold m can be think of a derivation x of the ring of smooth function on the manifold and therefore form a lie algebra under the lie bracket x because the lie bracket of any two derivation be a derivation if g be any group act smoothly on the manifold m then it act on the vector field and the vector space of vector field fix by the group be close under the lie bracket and therefore also form a lie algebra we apply this construction to the case when the manifold m be the underlying space of a lie group with g act on g by left translation lg h this show that the space of left invariant vector field vector field satisfy lg xh for every h in g where lg denote the differential of lg on a lie group be a lie algebra under the lie bracket of vector field any tangent vector at the identity of a lie group can be extend to a left invariant vector field by left translate the tangent vector to other point of the manifold specifically the left invariant extension of an element v of the tangent space at the identity be the vector field define by v g v this identify the tangent space teg at the identity with the space of left invariant vector field and therefore make the tangent space at the identity into a lie algebra call the lie algebra of g usually denote by a fraktur thus the lie bracket on be give explicitly by v e this lie algebra be and it have the same dimension a the manifold g the lie algebra of g determines g up to local isomorphism where two lie group be call isomorphic if they look the same near the identity element problem about lie group be often solve by first solve the corresponding problem for the lie algebra and the result for group then usually follow easily for example simple lie group be usually classify by first classify the corresponding lie algebra we could also define a lie algebra structure on te use right invariant vector field instead of left invariant vector field this lead to the same lie algebra because the inverse map on g can be use to identify left invariant vector field with right invariant vector field and act a on the tangent space te the lie algebra structure on te can also be describe a follow the commutator operation x y xyx y on g g send e to e so it derivative yield a bilinear operation on teg this bilinear operation be actually the zero map but the second derivative under the proper identification of tangent space yield an operation that satisfy the axiom of a lie bracket and it be equal to twice the one define through vector field homomorphism and isomorphisms if g and h be lie group then a lie group homomorphism f g h be a smooth group homomorphism in the case of complex lie group such a homomorphism be require to be a holomorphic map however these requirement be a bit stringent every continuous homomorphism between real lie group turn out to be real analytic the composition of two lie homomorphism be again a homomorphism and the class of all lie group together with these morphisms form a category moreover every lie group homomorphism induce a homomorphism between the correspond lie algebra let be a lie group homomorphism and let be it derivative at the identity if we identify the lie algebra of g and h with their tangent space at the identity element then be a map between the correspond lie algebra one can show that be actually a lie algebra homomorphism meaning that it be a linear map which preserve the lie bracket in the language of category theory we then have a covariant functor from the category of lie group to the category of lie algebra which send a lie group to it lie algebra and a lie group homomorphism to it derivative at the identity two lie group be call isomorphic if there exist a bijective homomorphism between them whose inverse be also a lie group homomorphism equivalently it be a diffeomorphism which be also a group homomorphism group versus lie algebra isomorphic lie group necessarily have isomorphic lie algebra it be then reasonable to ask how isomorphism class of lie group relate to isomorphism class of lie algebra the first result in this direction be lie third theorem which state that every real lie algebra be the lie algebra of some linear lie group one way to prove lie third theorem be to use ado theorem which say every real lie algebra be isomorphic to a matrix lie algebra meanwhile for every matrix lie algebra there be a linear group matrix lie group with this algebra a it lie algebra on the other hand lie group with isomorphic lie algebra need not be isomorphic furthermore this result remain true even if we assume the group be connect to put it differently the global structure of a lie group be not determine by it lie algebra for example if z be any discrete subgroup of the center of g then g and g z have the same lie algebra see the table of lie group for example an example of importance in physic be the group su and so these two group have isomorphic lie algebra but the group themselves be not isomorphic because su be simply connect but so be not on the other hand if we require that the lie group be simply connect then the global structure be determine by it lie algebra two simply connect lie group with isomorphic lie algebra be isomorphic see the next subsection for more information about simply connect lie group in light of lie third theorem we may therefore say that there be a correspondence between isomorphism class of real lie algebra and isomorphism class of simply connect lie group connect lie a lie group be say to be connect if every loop in can be shrink continuously to a point in this notion be important because of the following result that have simple connectedness a a hypothesis theorem suppose and be lie group with lie algebra and and that be a lie algebra homomorphism if be simply connect then there be a unique lie group homomorphism such that where be the differential of at the identity lie third theorem say that every real lie algebra be the lie algebra of a lie group it follow from lie third theorem and the precede result that every real lie algebra be the lie algebra of a unique simply connected lie group an example of a simply connect group be the special unitary group su which a a manifold be the the rotation group so on the other hand be not simply connect see topology of so the failure of so to be simply connect be intimately connect to the distinction between integer spin and spin in quantum mechanic other example of simply connect lie group include the special unitary group su n the spin group double cover of rotation group spin n for and the compact symplectic group sp n method for determine whether a lie group be simply connect or not be discuss in the article on fundamental group of lie group exponential the exponential map from the lie algebra of the general linear group to be define by the matrix exponential give by the usual power series for matrix if be a closed subgroup of then the exponential map take the lie algebra of into thus we have an exponential map for all matrix group every element of that be sufficiently close to the identity be the exponential of a matrix in the lie algebra the definition above be easy to use but it be not define for lie group that be not matrix group and it be not clear that the exponential map of a lie group do not depend on it representation a a matrix group we can solve both problem use a more abstract definition of the exponential map that work for all lie group a follow for each vector in the lie algebra of the tangent space to at the identity one prove that there be a unique subgroup such that say that be a subgroup mean simply that be a smooth map into and that for all and the operation on the right hand side be the group multiplication in the formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the exponential function justify the definition this be call the map and it map the lie algebra into the lie group it provide a diffeomorphism between a neighborhood of in and a neighborhood of in this exponential map be a generalization of the exponential function for real number because be the lie algebra of the lie group of positive real number with multiplication for complex number because be the lie algebra of the lie group of complex number with multiplication and for matrix because with the regular commutator be the lie algebra of the lie group of all invertible matrix because the exponential map be surjective on some neighbourhood of it be common to call element of the lie algebra generator of the group the subgroup of generate by be the identity component of the exponential map and the lie algebra determine the local group structure of every connect lie group because of the formula there exist a neighborhood of the zero element of such that for we have where the omit term be know and involve lie bracket of four or more element in case and commute this formula reduce to the familiar exponential law the exponential map relate lie group homomorphism that be if be a lie group homomorphism and the induced map on the corresponding lie algebra then for all we have in other word the following diagram commute center in short exp be a natural transformation from the functor lie to the identity functor on the category of lie group the exponential map from the lie algebra to the lie group be not always onto even if the group be connect though it do map onto the lie group for connect group that be either compact or nilpotent for example the exponential map of sl be not surjective also the exponential map be neither surjective nor injective for see below lie group model on c fréchet space even from arbitrary small neighborhood of to correspond neighborhood of lie subgroup a subgroup of a lie group be a lie group that be a subset of and such that the inclusion map from to be an injective immersion and group homomorphism accord to cartan theorem a closed subgroup of admits a unique smooth structure which make it an embedded lie subgroup of a lie subgroup such that the inclusion map be a smooth embed example of subgroup be plentiful for example take to be a torus of dimension or great and let be a subgroup of irrational slope one that wind around in g then there be a lie group homomorphism with the closure of will be a in the exponential map give a correspondence between the connect lie subgroup of a connected lie group and the subalgebras of the lie algebra of typically the subgroup correspond to a subalgebra be not a closed subgroup there be no criterion solely base on the structure of which determines which subalgebras correspond to close subgroup one important aspect of the study of lie group be their representation that be the way they can act linearly on vector space in physic lie group often encode the symmetry of a physical system the way one make use of this symmetry to help analyze the system be often through representation theory consider for example the schrödinger equation in quantum mechanic assume the system in question have the rotation group so a a symmetry meaning that the hamiltonian operator commute with the action of so on the wave function one important example of such a system be the hydrogen atom this assumption do not necessarily mean that the solution be rotationally invariant function rather it mean that the space of solution to be invariant under rotation for each fixed value of this space therefore constitute a representation of so these representation have be classify and the classification lead to a substantial simplification of the problem essentially convert a partial differential equation to a ordinary differential equation the case of a connected compact lie group k include the case of so be particularly tractable in that case every representation of k decomposes a a direct sum of irreducible representation the irreducible representation in turn be classify by hermann weyl the classification be in term of the high weight of the representation the classification be closely relate to the classification of representation of a semisimple lie algebra one can also study in general unitary representation of an arbitrary lie group not necessarily compact for example it be possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the representation of the group sl r and the representation of the poincaré group accord to the most authoritative source on the early history of lie group hawkins sophus lie himself consider the winter of a the birth date of his theory of continuous group hawkins however suggest that it be lie prodigious research activity during the period from the fall of to the fall of that lead to the theory creation ibid some of lie early idea be develop in close collaboration with felix klein lie meet with klein every day from october through in berlin from the end of october to the end of february and in paris göttingen and erlangen in the subsequent two year ibid lie state that all of the principal result be obtain by but during the all his paper except the very first note be publish in norwegian journal which impede recognition of the work throughout the rest of europe ibid in a young german mathematician friedrich engel come to work with lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous group from this effort result the theorie der transformationsgruppen publish in and the term group de lie first appear in french in in the thesis of lie student arthur tresse lie idea do not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics in fact his interest in the geometry of differential equation be first motivate by the work of carl gustav jacobi on the theory of partial differential equation of first order and on the equation of classical mechanic much of jacobi work be publish posthumously in the generate enormous interest in france and germany hawkins lie idée fixe be to develop a theory of symmetry of differential equation that would accomplish for them what évariste galois have do for algebraic equation namely to classify them in term of group theory lie and other mathematician show that the most important equation for special function and orthogonal polynomial tend to arise from group theoretical symmetry in lie early work the idea be to construct a theory of continuous group to complement the theory of discrete group that have develop in the theory of modular form in the hand of felix klein and henri poincaré the initial application that lie have in mind be to the theory of differential equation on the model of galois theory and polynomial equation the drive conception be of a theory capable of unify by the study of symmetry the whole area of ordinary differential equation however the hope that lie theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equation be not fulfil symmetry method for ode continue to be study but do not dominate the subject there be a differential galois theory but it be develop by others such a picard and vessiot and it provide a theory of quadrature the indefinite integral require to express solution additional impetus to consider continuous group come from idea of bernhard riemann on the foundation of geometry and their further development in the hand of klein thus three major theme in century mathematics be combine by lie in create his new theory the idea of symmetry a exemplify by galois through the algebraic notion of a group geometric theory and the explicit solution of differential equation of mechanic work out by poisson and jacobi and the new understanding of geometry that emerge in the work of plücker möbius grassmann and others and culminate in riemann revolutionary vision of the subject although today sophus lie be rightfully recognize a the creator of the theory of continuous group a major stride in the development of their structure theory which be to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics be make by wilhelm kill who in publish the first paper in a series entitle die zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen transformationsgruppen the composition of continuous finite transformation group hawkins the work of kill later refine and generalize by élie cartan lead to classification of semisimple lie algebras cartan theory of symmetric space and hermann weyl description of representation of compact and semisimple lie group use high weight in david hilbert challenge lie theorist with his fifth problem present at the international congress of mathematician in paris weyl bring the early period of the development of the theory of lie group to fruition for not only do he classify irreducible representation of semisimple lie group and connect the theory of group with quantum mechanic but he also put lie theory itself on firm footing by clearly enunciate the distinction between lie infinitesimal group lie algebra and the lie group proper and begin investigation of topology of lie group the theory of lie group be systematically rework in modern mathematical language in a monograph by claude chevalley lie group may be think of a smoothly vary family of symmetry example of symmetry include rotation about an axis what must be understood be the nature of transformation for example rotation through tiny angle that link nearby transformation the mathematical object capture this structure be call a lie algebra lie himself call them infinitesimal group it can be define because lie group be smooth manifold so have tangent space at each point the lie algebra of any compact lie group very roughly one for which the symmetry form a bounded set can be decompose a a direct sum of an abelian lie algebra and some number of simple one the structure of an abelian lie algebra be mathematically uninteresting since the lie bracket be identically zero the interest be in the simple summands hence the question arise what be the simple lie algebra of compact group it turn out that they mostly fall into four infinite family the classical lie algebras a n b n c n and d n which have simple description in term of symmetry of euclidean space but there be also just five exceptional lie algebra that do not fall into any of these family be the large of these lie group be classify accord to their algebraic property simple semisimple solvable nilpotent abelian their connectedness connect or simply connect and their compactness a first key result be the levi decomposition which say that every simply connect lie group be the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup compact lie group be all know they be finite central quotient of a product of copy of the circle group and simple compact lie group which correspond to connect dynkin diagram simply connect solvable lie group be isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrix of some rank and any irreducible representation of such a group be solvable group be too messy to classify except in a few small dimension simply connect nilpotent lie group be isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrix with on the diagonal of some rank and any irreducible representation of such a group be like solvable group nilpotent group be too messy to classify except in a few small dimension lie group be sometimes define to be those that be simple a abstract group and sometimes define to be connect lie group with a simple lie algebra for example sl be simple accord to the second definition but not accord to the first they have all be classify for either definition lie group be lie group whose lie algebra be a product of simple lie algebra they be central extension of product of simple lie group the identity component of any lie group be an open normal subgroup and the quotient group be a discrete group the universal cover of any connected lie group be a simply connected lie group and conversely any connected lie group be a quotient of a simply connected lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center any lie group g can be decompose into discrete simple and abelian group in a canonical way a follow write con for the connected component of the identity sol for the large connect normal solvable subgroup nil for the large connect normal nilpotent subgroup so that we have a sequence of normal subgroup g nil g sol g con g then g con be discrete g sol be a central extension of a product of simple connect lie group g nil be abelian a connected abelian lie group be isomorphic to a product of copy of and the circle group s be nilpotent and therefore it ascend central series have all quotient abelian this can be use to reduce some problem about lie group such a find their unitary representation to the same problem for connect simple group and nilpotent and solvable subgroup of small dimension the diffeomorphism group of a lie group act transitively on the lie group every lie group be parallelizable and hence an orientable manifold there be a bundle isomorphism between it tangent bundle and the product of itself with the tangent space at the identity lie group be often define to be but there be many group that resemble lie group except for be the simple way to define lie group be to model them locally on banach space a oppose to euclidean space in the case and in this case much of the basic theory be similar to that of lie group however this be inadequate for many application because many natural example of lie group be not banach manifold instead one need to define lie group model on more general locally convex topological vector space in this case the relation between the lie algebra and the lie group become rather subtle and several result about lie group no longer hold the literature be not entirely uniform in it terminology a to exactly which property of group qualify the group for the prefix lie in lie group on the lie algebra side of affair thing be simpler since the qualifying criterion for the prefix lie in lie algebra be purely algebraic for example an lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding lie group that be there may be a group correspond to the lie algebra but it might not be nice enough to be call a lie group or the connection between the group and the lie algebra might not be nice enough for example failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity it be the nice enough that be not universally define some of the example that have be study include group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold quite a lot be know about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle it lie algebra be more or less the witt algebra whose central extension the virasoro algebra see virasoro algebra from witt algebra for a derivation of this fact be the symmetry algebra of conformal

attempt to quantize gravity group of smooth map from a manifold to a lie group be an example of a gauge group with operation of pointwise multiplication and be use in quantum field theory and donaldson theory if the manifold be a circle these be call loop group and have central extension whose lie algebra be more or less algebra be analogue of general linear group orthogonal group and so

the manipulation of this rubik cube form the rubik cube group in mathematics a be a set equip with a binary operation that combine any two element to form a third element in such a way that four condition call group axiom be satisfied namely closure associativity identity and invertibility one of the most familiar example of a group be the set of integer together with the addition operation but group be encounter in numerous area within and outside mathematics and help focus on essential structural aspect by detach them from the concrete nature of the subject of the study group share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry for example a symmetry group encode symmetry feature of a geometrical object the group consist of the set of transformation that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combine two such transformation by perform one after the other lie group be the symmetry group use in the standard model of particle physic poincaré group which be also lie group can express the physical symmetry underlie special relativity and point group be use to help understand symmetry phenomenon in molecular chemistry the concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equation start with évariste galois in the who introduce the term of group groupe in french for the symmetry group of the root of an equation now call a galois group after contribution from other field such a number theory and geometry the group notion be generalize and firmly establish around modern group active mathematical group in their own right to explore group mathematician have devise various notion to break group into small piece such a subgroup quotient group and simple group in addition to their abstract property group theorist also study the different way in which a group can be express concretely both from a point of view of representation theory that be through the representation of the group and of computational group theory a theory have be develop for finite group which culminate with the classification of finite simple group complete in since the geometric group theory which study finitely generate group a geometric object have become an active area in group theory example the one of the most familiar group be the set of integer which consist of the number together with addition the follow property of integer addition serve a a model for the group axioms give in the definition below any two integer a and b the sum a b be also an integer that be addition of integer always yield an integer this property be know a closure under addition all integer a b and c a b c a b c express in word add a to b first and then add the result to c give the same final result a add a to the sum of b and c a property know a associativity a be any integer then a a a zero be call the identity element of addition because add it to any integer return the same integer every integer a there be an integer b such that a b b a the integer b be call the inverse element of the integer a and be denote a the integer together with the operation form a mathematical object belong to a broad class share similar structural aspect to appropriately understand these structure a a collective the following definition be develop a group be a set g together with an operation call the group law of g that combine any two element a and b to form another element denote or ab to qualify a a group the set and operation must satisfy four requirement know a the group axioms closure for all a b in g the result of the operation a b be also in g associativity for all a b and c in g a b c a b c identity element there exist an element e in g such that for every element a in g the equation hold such an element be unique see below and thus one speaks of the identity element inverse element for each a in g there exist an element b in g commonly denote a or a if the operation be denote such that a b b a e where e be the identity element the result of the group operation may depend on the order of the operand in other word the result of combine element a with element b need not yield the same result a combine element b with element a the equation may not be true for every two element a and b this equation always hold in the group of integer under addition because for any two integer commutativity of addition group for which the commutativity equation always hold be call abelian group in honor of niels henrik abel the symmetry group describe in the following section be an example of a group that be not abelian the identity element of a group g be often write a or g a notation inherit from the multiplicative identity if a group be abelian then one may choose to denote the group operation by and the identity element by in that case the group be call an additive group the identity element can also be write a id the set g be call the underlie set of the group often the group underlie set g be use a a short name for the group along the same line shorthand expression such a a subset of the group g or an element of group g be use when what be actually mean be a subset of the underlying set g of the group or an element of the underlying set g of the group usually it be clear from the context whether a symbol like g refers to a group or to an underlie set an alternate but equivalent definition be to expand the structure of a group to define a group a a set equip with three operation satisfy the same axiom a above with the there exist part remove in the two last axiom these operation be the group law a above which be a binary operation the inverse operation which be a unary operation and map to and the identity element which be view a a operation a this formulation of the definition avoid existential quantifier it be generally prefer for compute with group and for proof this formulation exhibit group a a variety of universal algebra it be also useful for talk of property of the inverse operation a need for define topological group and group object second example a symmetry group two figure in the plane be congruent if one can be change into the other use a combination of rotation reflection and translation any figure be congruent to itself however some figure be congruent to themselves in more than one way and these extra congruence be call symmetry a square have eight symmetry these be the element of the symmetry group of the square vertex be identify by color or number id keep it a it be rotation by clockwise rotation by clockwise rotation by clockwise fv vertical reflection fh horizontal reflection fd diagonal reflection fc reflection the identity operation leave everything unchanged denote id rotation of the square around it center by clockwise clockwise and clockwise denote by and respectively reflection about the horizontal and vertical middle line fv and fh or through the two diagonal fd and fc these symmetry be function each send a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry for example send a point to it rotation clockwise around the square center and fh send a point to it reflection across the square vertical middle line compose two of these symmetry give another symmetry these symmetry determine a group call the dihedral group of degree denote the underlying set of the group be the above set of symmetry and the group operation be function composition two symmetry be combine by compose them a function that be apply the first one to the square and the second one to the result of the first application the result of perform first a and then b be write symbolically from right to leave a apply the symmetry b after perform the symmetry a this be the usual notation for composition of function the group table on the right list the result of all such composition possible for example rotating by clockwise and then reflect horizontally fh be the same a perform a reflection along the diagonal fd use the above symbol highlight in blue in the group table group table of id fv fh fd fc id id fv fh fd fc id fc fd fv fh id fh fv fc fd id fd fc fh fv fv fv fd fh fc id fh fh fc fv fd id fd fd fh fc fv id fc fc fv fd fh id the element id and form a subgroup highlight in red upper leave region a left and right coset of this subgroup be highlight in green in the last row and yellow last column respectively give this set of symmetry and the described operation the group axiom can be understood a follow in contrast to the group of integer above where the order of the operation be irrelevant it do matter in a for example but in other word be not abelian which make the group structure more difficult than the integer introduce first the modern concept of an abstract group develop out of several field of mathematics the original motivation for group theory be the quest for solution of polynomial equation of degree high than the french mathematician évariste galois extend prior work of paolo ruffini and lagrange give a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in term of the symmetry group of it root solution the element of such a galois group correspond to certain permutation of the root at first galois idea be reject by his contemporary and publish only posthumously more general permutation group be investigate in particular by augustin louis cauchy arthur cayley on the theory of group a depend on the symbolic equation θn give the first abstract definition of a finite group geometry be a second field in which group be use systematically especially symmetry group a part of felix klein erlangen program after novel geometry such a hyperbolic and projective geometry have emerge klein use group theory to organize them in a more coherent way far advance these idea sophus lie found the study of lie group in the third field contribute to group theory be number theory certain abelian group structure have be use implicitly in carl friedrich gauss work disquisitiones arithmeticae and more explicitly by leopold kronecker in ernst kummer make early attempt to prove fermat last theorem by develop group describe factorization into prime number the convergence of these various source into a uniform theory of group start with camille jordan traité de substitution et de équations algébriques walther von dyck introduce the idea of specify a group by mean of generator and relation and be also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an abstract group in the terminology of the time a of the century group gain wide recognition by the pioneering work of ferdinand georg frobenius and william burnside who work on representation theory of finite group richard brauer modular representation theory and issai schur paper the theory of lie group and more generally locally compact group be study by hermann weyl élie cartan and many others it algebraic counterpart the theory of algebraic group be first shape by claude chevalley from the late and later by the work of armand borel and jacques tits the university of chicago group theory year bring together group theorist such a daniel gorenstein john thompson and walter feit lay the foundation of a collaboration that with input from numerous other mathematician lead to the classification of finite simple group with the final step take by aschbacher and smith in this project exceed previous mathematical endeavour by it sheer size in both length of proof and number of researcher research be ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification these day group theory be still a highly active mathematical branch impact many other field basic fact about all group that can be obtain directly from the group axiom be commonly subsume under elementary group theory for example repeat application of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of b c a b c a b c generalize to more than three factor because this imply that parenthesis can be insert anywhere within such a series of term parenthesis be usually omit the axiom may be weaken to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverse both can be show to be actually so the resulting definition be equivalent to the one give above of identity element and two important consequence of the group axiom be the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse element there can be only one identity element in a group and each element in a group have exactly one inverse element thus it be customary to speak of the identity and the inverse of an element to prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of a suppose that a have two inverse denote b and c in a group g then e a e be the identity element a c because c be an inverse of a so e a c b a c by associativity which allow rearrange the parenthesis c since b be an inverse of a b a e for e be the identity element the term b on the first line above and the c on the last be equal since they be connect by a chain of equality in other word there be only one inverse element of a similarly to prove that the identity element of a group be unique assume g be a group with two identity element e and f then e e f f hence e and f be equal in group the existence of inverse element implies that division be possible give element a and b of the group g there be exactly one solution x in g to the equation namely in fact we have uniqueness result by multiply the two side of the equation by the element often denote be call the right quotient of b by a or the result of the right division of b by a similarly there be exactly one solution y in g to the equation namely this solution be the left quotient of b by a and be sometimes denote in general and may be different but if the group operation be commutative that be if the group be abelian they be equal in this case the group operation be often denote a an addition and one talk of subtraction and difference instead of division and quotient a consequence of this be that multiplication by a group element g be a bijection specifically if g be an element of the group g the function from g to itself that map to be a bijection this function be call the left translation by g similarly the right translation by g be the bijection from g to itself that map h to if g be abelian the left and the right translation by a group element be the same following section use mathematical symbol such a to denote a set x contain element x y and z or alternatively to restate that x be an element of x notation mean f be a function assign to every element of x an element of y to understand group beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulation a above more structural concept have to be employ there be a conceptual principle underlie all of the following notion to take advantage of the structure offer by group which set be structureless do not have construction relate to group have to be compatible with the group operation this compatibility manifest itself in the following notion in various way for example group can be relate to each other via function call group homomorphism by the mention principle they be require to respect the group structure in a precise sense the structure of group can also be understand by break them into piece call subgroup and quotient group the principle of preserve structure recur topic in mathematics an instance of work in a category in this case the category of group homomorphism be function that preserve group structure a function between two group and be call a homomorphism if the equation hold for all element g k in g in other word the result be the same when perform the group operation after or before apply the map a this requirement ensure that and also for all g in g thus a group homomorphism respect all the structure of g provide by the group axioms two group g and h be call isomorphic if there exist group homomorphism and such that apply the two function one after another in each of the two possible order give the identity function of g and h that be and for any g in g and h in h from an abstract point of view isomorphic group carry the same information for example proving that for some element g of g be equivalent to prove that because apply a to the first equality yield the second and apply b to the second give back the first informally a subgroup be a group h contain within a big one g concretely the identity element of g be contain in h and whenever h and h be in h then so be and h so the element of h equip with the group operation on g restrict to h indeed form a group in the example above the identity and the rotation constitute a subgroup highlight in red in the group table above any two rotation compose be still a rotation and a rotation can be undone by be inverse to the complementary rotation for for and for note that rotation in the opposite direction be not define the subgroup test be a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset h of a group g to be a subgroup it be sufficient to check that for all element know the subgroup be important in understand the group a a whole give any subset s of a group g the subgroup generate by s consists of product of element of s and their inverse it be the small subgroup of g contain s in the introductory example above the subgroup generate by and fv consists of these two element the identity element id and again this be a subgroup because combine any two of these four element or their inverse which be in this particular case these same element yield an element of this subgroup in many situation it be desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a give subgroup for example in above once a reflection be perform the square never get back to the configuration by just apply the rotation operation and no further reflection the rotation operation be irrelevant to the question whether a reflection have be perform cosets be use to formalize this insight a subgroup h defines leave and right cosets which can be think of a translation of h by arbitrary group element g in symbolic term the left and right cosets of h contain g be and respectively the left cosets of any subgroup h form a partition of g that be the union of all left cosets be equal to g and two left cosets be either equal or have an empty intersection the first case happen precisely when if the two element differ by an element of h similar consideration apply to the right cosets of h the left and right cosets of h may or may not be equal if they be for all g in g then h be say to be a normal subgroup in the introductory symmetry group the leave cosets gr of the subgroup r consisting of the rotation be either equal to r if g be an element of r itself or otherwise equal to highlight in green the subgroup r be also normal because and similarly for any element other than fc in fact in the case of observe that all such cosets be equal such that in some situation the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endow with a group law give a quotient group or factor group for this to be possible the subgroup have to be normal give any normal subgroup n the quotient group be define by n gn g g modulo n this set inherit a group operation sometimes call coset multiplication or coset addition from the original group g for all g and h in g this definition be motivate by the idea itself an instance of general structural consideration outline above that the map that associate to any element g it coset gn be a group homomorphism or by general abstract consideration call universal property the coset serve a the identity in this group and the inverse of gn in the quotient group be group table of the quotient group r u r r u u u r the element of the quotient group be r itself which represent the identity and the group operation on the quotient be show at the right for example both the subgroup as well a the corresponding quotient be abelian whereas be not abelian building big group by small one such a from it subgroup r and the quotient be abstract by a notion call semidirect product quotient group and subgroup together form a way of describe every group by it presentation any group be the quotient of the free group over the generator of the group quotiented by the subgroup of relation the dihedral group for example can be generate by two element r and f for example r the right rotation and f fv the vertical or any other reflection which mean that every symmetry of the square be a finite composition of these two symmetry or their inverse together with the relation r f the group be completely describe a presentation of a group can also be use to construct the cayley graph a device use to graphically capture discrete group and quotient group be relate in the following way a subset h of g can be see a an injective map any element of the target have at most one element that map to it the counterpart to injective map be surjective map every element of the target be map onto such a the canonical map interpret subgroup and quotient in light of these homomorphism emphasize the structural concept inherent to these definition allude to in the introduction in general homomorphism be neither injective nor surjective kernel and image of group homomorphism and the first isomorphism theorem address this phenomenon examples and application of group abound a starting point be the group of integer with addition a group operation introduce above if instead of addition multiplication be consider one obtain multiplicative group these group be predecessor of important construction in abstract algebra group be also apply in many other mathematical area mathematical object be often examine by associate group to them and study the property of the corresponding group for example henri poincaré found what be now call algebraic topology by introduce the fundamental group by mean of this connection topological property such a proximity and continuity translate into property of group for example element of the fundamental group be represent by loop the second image at the right show some loop in a plane minus a point the blue loop be consider and thus irrelevant because it can be continuously shrink to a point the presence of the hole prevent the orange loop from be shrink to a point the fundamental group of the plane with a point delete turn out to be infinite cyclic generate by the orange loop or any other loop wind once around the hole this way the fundamental group detect the hole in more recent application the influence have also be reverse to motivate geometric construction by a background in a similar vein geometric group theory employ geometric concept for example in the study of hyperbolic group far branch crucially apply group include algebraic geometry and number theory in addition to the above theoretical application many practical application of group exist cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtain in computational group theory in particular when implement for finite group application of group theory be not restrict to mathematics science such a physic chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept number many number system such a the integer and the rational enjoy a naturally give group structure in some case such a with the rational both addition and multiplication operation give rise to group structure such number system be predecessor to more general algebraic structure know a ring and field far abstract algebraic concept such a module vector space and algebra also form group integer the group of integer under addition denote have be describe above the integer with the operation of multiplication instead of addition do not form a group the closure associativity and identity axiom be satisfied but inverse do not exist for example be an integer but the only solution to the equation in this case be which be a rational number but not an integer hence not every element of have a multiplicative inverse rational the desire for the existence of multiplicative inverse suggest consider fraction fraction of integer with b nonzero be know a rational number the set of all such irreducible fraction be commonly denote there be still a minor obstacle for the rational with multiplication be a group because the rational number do not have a multiplicative inverse there be no x such that be still not a group however the set of all nonzero rational number do form an abelian group under multiplication generally denote associativity and identity element axiom follow from the property of integer the closure requirement still hold true after remove zero because the product of two nonzero rational be never zero finally the inverse of a b be b a therefore the axiom of the inverse element be satisfied the rational number include also form a group under addition intertwine addition and multiplication operation yield more complicated structure call ring division be possible such a in which occupy a central position in abstract algebra group theoretic argument therefore underlie part of the theory of those entity addition modulo here in modular arithmetic two integer be add and then the sum be divide by a positive integer call the modulus the result of modular addition be the remainder of that division for any modulus n the set of integer from to form a group under modular addition the inverse of any element a be and be the identity element this be familiar from the addition of hour on the face of a clock if the hour hand be on and be advanced hour it end up on a show at the right this be express by say that equal modulo or in symbol modulo the group of integer modulo n be write or for any prime number p there be also the multiplicative group of integer modulo p it element be the integer to the group operation be multiplication modulo p that be the usual product be divide by p and the remainder of this division be the result of modular multiplication for example if there be four group element in this group because the usual product be equivalent to which divide by yield a remainder of for divide denote mod the primality of p ensures that the product of two integer neither of which be divisible by p be not divisible by p either hence the indicated set of class be close under multiplication the identity element be as usual for a multiplicative group and the associativity follow from the correspond property of integer finally the inverse element axiom require that give an integer a not divisible by p there exist an integer b such that mod p p divide the difference the inverse b can be find by use bézout identity and the fact that the great common divisor equal in the case above the inverse of be and the inverse of be a hence all group axiom be fulfil actually this example be similar to above it consist of exactly those element in that have a multiplicative inverse these group be denote p they be crucial to cryptography the complex root of unity form a cyclic group be a primitive element but z be not because the odd power of z be not a power of z a cyclic group be a group all of whose element be power of a particular element a in multiplicative notation the element of the group be a a a a e a a a where a mean a a and stand for a a a a a a etc such an element a be call a generator or a primitive element of the group in additive notation the requirement for an element to be primitive be that each element of the group can be write a a a a a a a in the group n z introduce above the element be primitive so these group be cyclic indeed each element be expressible a a sum all of whose term be any cyclic group with n element be isomorphic to this group a second example for cyclic group be the group of n complex root of unity give by complex number z satisfy these number can be visualize a the vertex on a regular n a show in blue at the right for the group operation be multiplication of complex number in the picture multiply with z corresponds to a rotation by use some field theory the group p can be show to be cyclic for example if be a generator since and some cyclic group have an infinite number of element in these group for every element a all the power of a be distinct despite the name cyclic group the power of the element do not cycle an infinite cyclic group be isomorphic to the group of integer under addition introduce above a these two prototype be both abelian so be any cyclic group the study of finitely generate abelian group be quite mature include the fundamental theorem of finitely generate abelian group and reflect this state of affair many notion such a center and commutator describe the extent to which a give group be not abelian group be group consist of symmetry of give mathematical they of geometric nature such a the introductory symmetry group of the square or of algebraic nature such a polynomial equation and their solution conceptually group theory can be think of a the study of symmetry symmetry in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical object a group be say to act on another mathematical object x if every group element perform some operation on x compatibly to the group law in the rightmost example below an element of order of the triangle group act on the tiling by permute the highlight warp triangle and the other one too by a group action the group pattern be connect to the structure of the object be act on rotation and reflection form the symmetry group of a great icosahedron in chemical field such a crystallography space group and point group describe molecular symmetry and crystal symmetry these symmetry underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these system and group theory enable simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these property for example group theory be use to show that optical transition between certain quantum level can not occur simply because of the symmetry of the state involve not only be group useful to assess the implication of symmetry in molecule but surprisingly they also predict that molecule sometimes can change symmetry the effect be a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopt a particular ground state of low symmetry from a set of possible ground state that be relate to each other by the symmetry operation of the molecule likewise group theory help predict the change in physical property that occur when a material undergo a phase transition for example from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form an example be ferroelectric material where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the curie temperature and be relate to a change from the paraelectric state to the low symmetry ferroelectric state accompany by a soft phonon mode a vibrational lattice mode that go to zero frequency at the transition such spontaneous symmetry breaking have find further application in elementary particle physic where it occurrence be relate to the appearance of goldstone boson buckminsterfullerene displaysicosahedral symmetry though the double bond reduce this to pyritohedral symmetry ammonia it symmetry group be of order generate by a rotation and a reflection cubane feature octahedral symmetry hexaaquacopper ii complex ion compare to a perfectly symmetrical shape the molecule be vertically dilate by about effect the triangle group a hyperbolic group act on this tiling of the hyperbolic plane finite symmetry group such a the mathieu group be use in cod theory which be in turn apply in error correction of transmit data and in cd player another application be differential galois theory which characterize function have antiderivatives of a prescribed form give criterion for when solution of certain differential equation be geometric property that remain stable under group action be investigate in geometric invariant theory linear group and representation vector the left illustration multiply by matrix the middle and right illustration the middle illustration represent a clockwise rotation by while the one stretch the x by factor matrix group consist of matrix together with matrix multiplication the general linear group consist of all invertible n n matrix with real entry it subgroup be refer to a matrix group or linear group the dihedral group example mention above can be view a a very small matrix group another important matrix group be the special orthogonal group so n it describe all possible rotation in n dimension via euler angle rotation matrix be use in computer graphic theory be both an application of the group concept and important for a deep understanding of group it study the group by it group action on other space a broad class of group representation be linear representation the group be act on a vector space such a the euclidean space a representation of g on an n real vector space be simply a group homomorphism g gl n from the group to the general linear group this way the group operation which may be abstractly give translates to the multiplication of matrix make it accessible to explicit computation give a group action this give further mean to study the object be act on on the other hand it also yield information about the group group representation be an organize principle in the theory of finite group lie group algebraic group and topological group especially locally compact group galois group group be develop to help solve polynomial equation by capture their symmetry feature for example the solution of the quadratic equation be give by exchange and in the expression permute the two solution of the equation can be view a a very simple group operation similar formula be know for cubic and quartic equation but do not exist in general for degree and high abstract property of galois group associate with polynomial in particular their solvability give a criterion for polynomial that have all their solution expressible by radical solution expressible use solely addition multiplication and root similar to the formula above the problem can be deal with by shift to field theory and consider the splitting field of a polynomial modern galois theory generalize the above type of galois group to field extension and the fundamental theorem of galois precise relationship between field and group underline once again the ubiquity of group in mathematics a group be call finite if it have a finite number of element the number of element be call the order of the group an important class be the symmetric group s n the group of permutation of n letter for example the symmetric group on letter be the group consist of all possible ordering of the three letter abc contain the element abc acb bac bca cab cba in total factorial of element this class be fundamental insofar a any finite group can be express a a subgroup of a symmetric group s n for a suitable integer n accord to cayley theorem parallel to the group of symmetry of the square above can also be interpret a the group of symmetry of an equilateral triangle the order of an element a in a group g be the least positive integer n such that a where a represent application of the operation to n copy of a if represent multiplication then a corresponds to the n th power of a in infinite group such an n may not exist in which case the order of a be say to be infinity the order of an element equal the order of the cyclic subgroup generate by this element more sophisticated counting technique for example count cosets yield more precise statement about finite group lagrange theorem state that for a finite group g the order of any finite subgroup h divide the order of g the sylow theorem give a partial converse the dihedral group discuss above be a finite group of order the order of be as be the order of the subgroup r it generate see above the order of the reflection element fv etc be both order divide a predict by lagrange theorem the group p above have order classification of finite simple group mathematician often strive for a complete classification or list of a mathematical notion in the context of finite group this aim lead to difficult mathematics accord to lagrange theorem finite group of order p a prime number be necessarily cyclic abelian group p group of order p can also be show to be abelian a statement which do not generalize to order p a the group of order above show computer algebra system can be use to list small group but there be no classification of all finite group an intermediate step be the classification of finite simple group a nontrivial group be call simple if it only normal subgroup be the trivial group and the group itself the theorem exhibit finite simple group a the building block for all finite group list all finite simple group be a major achievement in contemporary group theory field medal winner richard borcherds succeed in prove the monstrous moonshine conjecture a surprising and deep relation between the large finite simple sporadic monster group certain modular function a piece of classical complex analysis and string theory a theory suppose to unify the description of many physical phenomenon many group be simultaneously group and example of other mathematical structure in the language of category theory they be group object in a category meaning that they be object that be example of another mathematical structure which come with transformation call morphisms that mimic the group axioms for example every group a define above be also a set so a group be a group object in the category of set the unit circle in the complex plane under complex multiplication be a lie group and therefore a topological group it be topological since complex multiplication and division be continuous it be a manifold and thus a lie group because every small piece such a the red arc in the figure look like a part of the real line show at the bottom some topological space may be endow with a group law in order for the group law and the topology to interweave well the group operation must be continuous function that be and g must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little such group be call topological group and they be the group object in the category of topological space the most basic example be the real under addition and similarly with any other topological field such a the complex number or p number all of these group be locally compact so they have haar measure and can be study via harmonic analysis the former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integral invariance mean in the case of real number for example for any constant c matrix group over these field fall under this regime a do adele ring and adelic algebraic group which be basic to number theory galois group of infinite field extension such a the absolute galois group can also be equip with a topology the krull topology which in turn be central to generalize the above sketch connection of field and group to infinite field extension an advanced generalization of this idea adapt to the need of algebraic geometry be the étale fundamental group group in honor of sophus lie be group which also have a manifold structure they be space look locally like some euclidean space of the appropriate dimension again the additional structure here the manifold structure have to be compatible the map correspond

a metastable state of weak bond a transitional configuration and a stable state of strong bond in physic be a stable state of a dynamical system other than the system state of least energy a ball resting in a hollow on a slope be a simple example of metastability if the ball be only slightly push it will settle back into it hollow but a strong push may start the ball roll down the slope bowling pin show similar metastability by either merely wobble for a moment or tipping over completely a common example of metastability in science be isomerisation high energy isomer be long live because they be prevent from rearrange to their prefer ground state by possibly large barrier in the potential energy during a metastable state of finite lifetime all parameter reach and hold stationary value in isolation state of least energy be the only one the system will inhabit for an indefinite length of time until more external energy be add to the system unique absolutely stable state system will spontaneously leave any other state of high energy to eventually return after a sequence of transition to the least energetic state the metastability concept originate in the physic of phase transition it then acquire new meaning in the study of aggregated subatomic particle in atomic nucleus or in atom or in molecule macromolecule or cluster of atom and molecule later it be borrow for the study of and information transmission system many complex natural and system can demonstrate metastability be common in physic and chemistry from an atom assembly to statistical ensemble of molecule viscous fluid amorphous solid liquid crystal mineral etc at molecular level or a a whole see metastable state of matter and grain pile below the abundance of state be more prevalent a the system grow large if the force of their mutual interaction be spatially less uniform or more diverse dynamic system with feedback like electronic circuit signal trafficking decisional system and neuroscience the of the active or reactive pattern with respect to the external influence defines stability and metastability see brain metastability below in these system the equivalent of thermal fluctuation in molecular system be the white noise that affect signal propagation and the physic and thermodynamics be a branch of physic that study the dynamic of statistical ensemble of molecule via unstable state be stick in a thermodynamic trough without be at the low energy state be know a have kinetic stability or be kinetically persistent the particular motion or kinetics of the atom involve have result in get stuck despite there be preferable alternative of metastable state of matter also refer a metastates range from melt solid or freeze liquid boil liquid or condense gas and sublimate solid to supercooled liquid or superheated mixture extremely pure supercooled water stay liquid below and remain so until applied vibration or condense seed dope initiate crystallization center this be a common situation for the droplet of atmospheric cloud matter and metastable phase be common in condensed matter and crystallography notably this be the case for anatase a metastable polymorph of titanium dioxide which despite commonly be the first phase to form in many synthesis process due to it low surface energy be always metastable with rutile be the most stable phase at all temperature and pressure a another example diamond be a stable phase only at very high pressure but be a metastable form of carbon at standard temperature and pressure it can be convert to graphite plus leftover kinetic energy but only after overcome an activation energy an intervening hill martensite be a metastable phase use to control the hardness of most steel metastable polymorph of silica be commonly observe in some case such a in the allotrope of solid boron acquire a sample of the stable phase be difficult the bond between the building block of polymer such a dna rna and protein be also metastable adenosine triphosphate be a highly metastable molecule colloquially describe a be full of energy that can be use in many way in biology generally speak system and glass be metastable the metastability of silica glass be characterise by lifetime of the order of year compare with the lifetime of the universe which be about year sandpile be one system which can exhibit metastability if a steep slope or tunnel be present sand grain form a pile due to friction it be possible for an entire large sand pile to reach a point where it be stable but the addition of a single grain cause large part of it to collapse the avalanche be a problem with large pile of snow and ice crystal on steep slope in dry condition snow slop act similarly to sandpiles an entire mountainside of snow can suddenly slide due to the presence of a skier or even a loud noise or vibration aggregate system of subatomic particle describe by quantum mechanic quark inside nucleon nucleon inside atomic nuclei electron inside atom molecule or atomic cluster be find to have many distinguishable state of these one or a small degenerate set be indefinitely stable the ground state or global minimum all other state besides the ground state or those degenerate with it have high energy of all these other state the state be the one have lifetimes last at least to time long than the short lived state of the set a metastable state be then locally stable with respect to configuration of energy but not eternal a the global minimum be be excite of an energy above the ground state it will eventually decay to a more stable state release energy indeed above absolute zero all state of a system have a probability to decay that be to spontaneously fall into another state usually low in energy one mechanism for this to happen be through tunnel some energetic state of an atomic nucleus have distinct spatial mass charge spin isospin distribution be much than other nuclear isomer of the same isotope the isotope although be a metastable excited state be enough that it have never be observe to decay with a calculate to be least year over million time the current age of the universe and molecular some atomic energy level be metastable rydberg atom be an example of metastable excited atomic state transition from metastable excited level be typically those forbid by electric dipole selection rule this mean that any transition from this level be relatively unlikely to occur in a sense an electron that happen to find itself in a metastable configuration be trap there of course since transition from a metastable state be not impossible merely less likely the electron will eventually decay to a less energetic state typically by an electric quadrupole transition or often by collisional this property of a metastable state be apparent in phosphorescence the kind of photoluminescence see in toy that can be charge by first be expose to bright light whereas spontaneous emission in atom have a typical timescale on the order of second the decay of metastable state can typically take millisecond to minute and so light emit in phosphorescence be usually both weak and in chemical system a system of atom or molecule involve a change in chemical bond can be in a metastable state which last for a relatively long period of time molecular vibration and thermal motion make chemical specie at the energetic equivalent of the top of a round hill very metastable state that persist for many second or year be find in energetic valley which be not the low possible valley point in illustration a common type of metastability be isomerism the stability or metastability of a give chemical system depend on it environment particularly temperature and pressure the difference between produce a stable metastable entity can have important consequence for instance have the wrong crystal polymorph can result in failure of a drug while in storage between manufacture and administration the map of which state be the most stable a a function of pressure temperature composition be know a a phase diagram in region where a particular state be not the most stable it may still be metastable reaction intermediate be relatively and be usually thermodynamically unstable rather than metastable the iupac recommend refer to these a transient rather than metastable metastability be also use to refer to specific situation in mass spectrometry and spectrochemistry a digital circuit be suppose to be find in a small number of stable digital state within a certain amount of time after an input change however if an input change at the wrong moment a digital circuit which employ feedback even a simple circuit such a a can enter a metastable state and take an unbounded length of time to finally settle into a fully stable digital state metastability in the brain be a phenomenon study in computational neuroscience to elucidate how the human brain recognizes pattern here the term metastability be use rather loosely there be no state but there be signal in the brain that persist for a while and be different than the usual equilibrium state vacuum,Metastability,Subfields of physics,Mechanics
eukaryotic cell rna be transcribe in the nucleus after process it be transport to the cytoplasm and translate by the ribosome finally the mrna be degrade messenger rna be a rna molecule that correspond to the genetic sequence of a gene and be read by the ribosome in the process of produce a protein mrna be create during the process of transcription where the enzyme rna polymerase convert gene into primary transcript mrna also know a this usually still contain intron region that will not go on to code for the final amino acid sequence these be remove in the process of rna splice leave only exon region that will encode the protein this exon sequence constitutes mature mrna mature mrna be then read by the ribosome and utilising amino acid carry by transfer rna trna the ribosome create the protein this process be know a translation all of these process form part of the central dogma of molecular biology which describe the flow of genetic information in a biological system like in dna mrna genetic information be in the sequence of nucleotide which be arrange into codon consist of three base pair each each codon code for a specific amino acid except the stop codon which terminate protein synthesis this process of translation of codon into amino acid require two other type of rna transfer rna which recognise the codon and provide the corresponding amino acid and ribosomal rna rrna the central component of the ribosome machinery the existence of mrna be first suggest by jacques monod and françois jacob and be subsequently discover by jacob sydney brenner and matthew meselson at the california institute of technology in the brief existence of an mrna molecule begin with transcription and ultimately end in degradation during it life an mrna molecule may also be process edited and transported prior to translation eukaryotic mrna molecule often require extensive processing and transport while prokaryotic mrna molecule do not a molecule of eukaryotic mrna and the protein surround it be together call a messenger rnp transcription be when rna be make from dna during transcription rna polymerase make a copy of a gene from the dna to mrna a need this process be similar in eukaryote and prokaryotes one notable difference however be that eukaryotic rna polymerase associate with enzyme during transcription so that processing can proceed quickly after the start of transcription the unprocessed or partially processed product be term precursor mrna or once completely process it be termed mature mrna eukaryotic processing processing of mrna differs greatly among eukaryote bacteria and archea mrna be in essence mature upon transcription and require no processing except in rare case eukaryotic however require several process step before it transport to the cytoplasm and it translation by the ribosome splice the extensive processing of eukaryotic that lead to the mature mrna be the rna splice a mechanism by which intron or outrons region be remove and exon cod region be join together cap addition a cap also term an rna cap an rna cap or an rna cap be a modified guanine nucleotide that have be add to the front or end of a eukaryotic messenger rna shortly after the start of transcription the cap consist of a terminal residue that be link through a bond to the first transcribed nucleotide it presence be critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from rnase cap addition be couple to transcription and occurs such that each influence the other shortly after the start of transcription the end of the mrna be synthesize be bind by a complex associate with rna polymerase this enzymatic complex catalyze the chemical reaction that be require for mrna cap synthesis proceeds a a biochemical reaction in some instance an mrna will be edit change the nucleotide composition of that mrna an example in human be the apolipoprotein b mrna which be edit in some tissue but not others the edit creates an early stop codon which upon translation produce a shorter protein polyadenylation polyadenylation be the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger rna molecule in eukaryotic organism most messenger rna mrna molecule be polyadenylated at the end but recent study have show that short stretch of uridine oligouridylation be also common the poly a tail and the protein bound to it aid in protect mrna from degradation by exonuclease polyadenylation be also important for transcription termination export of the mrna from the nucleus and translation mrna can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organism where poly a tails act to facilitate rather than impede exonucleolytic degradation polyadenylation occur during immediately after transcription of dna into rna after transcription have be terminate the mrna chain be cleave through the action of an endonuclease complex associate with rna polymerase after the mrna have be cleave around adenosine residue be add to the free end at the cleavage site this reaction be catalyze by polyadenylate polymerase just a in alternative splicing there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mrna polyadenylation site mutation also occur the primary rna transcript of a gene be cleave at the addition site and a be add to the end of the rna if this site be alter an abnormally long and unstable mrna construct will be form another difference between eukaryote and prokaryote be mrna transport because eukaryotic transcription and translation be compartmentally separate eukaryotic mrna must be export from the nucleus to the process that may be regulate by different signal pathways mature mrna be recognize by their processed modification and then export through the nuclear pore by bind to the protein and as well a the complex trex multiple mrna export pathway have be identify in eukaryote in spatially complex cell some mrna be transport to particular subcellar destination in mature neuron certain mrna be transport from the soma to dendrites one site of mrna translation be at polyribosomes selectively localize beneath synapses the mrna for be induce by synaptic activity and localize selectively near active synapsis base on signal generate by nmda receptor other mrna also move into dendrite in response to external stimulus such a mrna upon export from the nucleus actin mrna associate with and the subunit the complex be bind by a motor protein and be transport to the target location neurite extension along the cytoskeleton eventually be phosphorylated by src in order for translation to be initiate in develop neuron mrna be also transport into grow axon and especially growth cone many mrna be mark with zip code which target their transport to a specific location because prokaryotic mrna do not need to be process or transport translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription therefore it can be say that prokaryotic translation be couple to transcription and occur eukaryotic mrna that have be process and transport to the cytoplasm mature mrna can then be translate by the ribosome translation may occur at ribosome in the cytoplasm or direct to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle therefore unlike in prokaryote eukaryotic translation be not directly couple to transcription it be even possible in some context that reduce mrna level be accompany by increased protein level a have be observe for level of in breast cancer the structure of a mature eukaryotic mrna a fully process mrna include a cap utr cod region utr and poly a tail coding region cod region be compose of codon which be decode and translate in eukaryote usually into one and in prokaryote usually into several into protein by the ribosome coding region begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon in general the start codon be an aug triplet and the stop codon be uag amber uaa ochre or uga opal the coding region tend to be stabilise by internal base pair this impede degradation in addition to be portion of cod region may serve a regulatory sequence in the a exonic splice enhancer or exonic splicing silencer untranslated region untranslated region utrs be section of the mrna before the start codon and after the stop codon that be not translate term the five prime untranslated region utr and three prime untranslated region utr respectively these region be transcribe with the cod region and thus be exonic a they be present in the mature mrna several role in gene expression have be attribute to the untranslated region include mrna stability mrna localization and translational efficiency the ability of a utr to perform these function depend on the sequence of the utr and can differ between mrna genetic variant in utr have also be implicate in disease susceptibility because of the change in rna structure and protein translation the stability of mrna may be control by the utr utr due to vary affinity for rna degrade enzyme call ribonuclease and for ancillary protein that can promote or inhibit rna degradation see also stability element translational efficiency include sometimes the complete inhibition of translation can be control by utrs protein that bind to either the or utr may affect translation by influence the ribosome ability to bind to the mrna micrornas bound to the utr also may affect translational efficiency or mrna stability cytoplasmic localization of mrna be think to be a function of the utr protein that be need in a particular region of the cell can also be translate there in such a case the utr may contain sequence that allow the transcript to be localize to this region for translation some of the element contain in untranslated region form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribe into rna these structural mrna element be involve in regulate the mrna some such a the secis element be target for protein to bind one class of mrna element the riboswitches directly bind small molecule change their fold to modify level of transcription or translation in these case the mrna regulate itself a the poly a tail be a long sequence of adenine nucleotide often several hundred add to the end of the this tail promote export from the nucleus and translation and protect the mrna from degradation monocistronic versus polycistronic mrna an mrna molecule be say to be monocistronic when it contain the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain polypeptide this be the case for most of the eukaryotic mrna on the other hand polycistronic mrna carry several open read frame orfs each of which be translate into a polypeptide these polypeptide usually have a relate function they often be the subunit compose a final complex protein and their coding sequence be group and regulate together in a regulatory region contain a promoter and an operator most of the mrna find in bacteria and archaea be polycistronic a be the human mitochondrial genome dicistronic or bicistronic mrna encode only two protein mrna circularization in eukaryote mrna molecule form circular structure due to an interaction between the and poly a protein which both bind to form an bridge circularization be think to promote cycling of ribosome on the mrna lead to translation and may also function to ensure only intact mrna be translate partially degrade mrna characteristically have no cap or no tail other mechanism for circularization exist particularly in virus mrna poliovirus mrna use a cloverleaf section towards it end to bind which bind poly a protein form the familiar circle barley yellow dwarf virus have bind between mrna segment on it end and end call kiss stem loop circularize the mrna without any protein involve rna virus genomes the strand of which be translate a mrna be also commonly circularize during genome replication the circularization act to enhance genome replication speed cycle viral rna polymerase much the same a the ribosome be hypothesize to cycle different mrna within the same cell have distinct lifetime stability in bacterial cell individual mrna can survive from second to more than an hour however the lifetime average between and minute make bacterial mrna much less stable than eukaryotic mrna in mammalian cell mrna lifetime range from several minute to day the great the stability of an mrna the more protein may be produce from that mrna the limited lifetime of mrna enable a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to it change need there be many mechanism that lead to the destruction of an mrna some of which be describe below mrna in general in prokaryotes the lifetime of mrna be much short than in eukaryote prokaryote degrade message by use a combination of ribonuclease include endonuclease exonuclease and exonuclease in some instance small rna molecule srna ten to hundred of nucleotide long can stimulate the degradation of specific mrna by with complementary sequence and facilitate ribonuclease cleavage by rnase iii it be recently show that bacteria also have a sort of cap consisting of a triphosphate on the end removal of two of the phosphate leave a monophosphate cause the message to be destroy by the exonuclease rnase j which degrade to mrna inside eukaryotic cell there be a balance between the process of translation and mrna decay message that be be actively translate be bind by ribosome the eukaryotic initiation factor and and poly a protein and block the decapping enzyme and poly a protein block the exosome complex protect the end of the message the balance between translation and decay be reflect in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structure know a the poly a tail of the mrna be shorten by specialized exonuclease that be target to specific messenger rna by a combination of sequence on the rna and proteins poly a tail removal be think to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex the message be then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex in this way translationally inactive message can be destroy quickly while active message remain intact the mechanism by which translation stop and the message be to decay complex be not understood in detail element the presence of element in some mammalian mrna tend to destabilize those transcript through the action of cellular protein that bind these sequence and stimulate poly a tail removal loss of the poly a tail be think to promote mrna degradation by facilitate attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex rapid mrna degradation via element be a critical mechanism for prevent the overproduction of potent cytokine such a tumor necrosis factor tnf and colony stimulate factor element also regulate the biosynthesis of transcription factor like and mediate eukaryotic message be subject to surveillance by nonsense mediate decay nmd which check for the presence of premature stop codon nonsense codon in the message these can arise via incomplete splice v d j recombination in the adaptive immune system mutation in dna transcription error leaky scan by the ribosome cause a frame shift and other cause detection of a premature stop codon trigger mrna degradation by decapping poly a tail removal or endonucleolytic cleavage interfere rna sirna in metazoan small interfere rnas sirnas process by dicer be incorporate into a complex know a the silencing complex or risc this complex contain an endonuclease that cleave perfectly complementary message to which the sirna bind the result mrna fragment be then destroy by exonuclease sirna be commonly use in laboratory to block the function of gene in cell culture it be think to be part of the innate immune system a a defense against rna virus mirna micrornas mirnas be small rna that typically be partially complementary to sequence in metazoan messenger rnas binding of a mirna to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly a tail removal thereby hasten mrna degradation the mechanism of action of mirnas be the subject of active research decay there be other way by which message can be degrade include decay and silencing by rna pirna among others full length mrna molecule have be propose a therapeutic since the beginning of the biotech era but there be little traction until the when moderna therapeutic be found and manage to raise almost a billion dollar in venture funding in it first three year theoretically the administered mrna sequence can cause a cell to make a protein which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function a a vaccine more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous stem cell to differentiate in a desired way the primary challenge of rna therapy center on deliver the rna to direct cell more even than determine what sequence to deliver naked rna sequence will naturally degrade after preparation they may trigger the body immune system to attack them a an invader and they be impermeable to the cell membrane once within the cell they must then leave the cell transport mechanism to take action within the cytoplasm which house the ribosome that direct manufacture of protein

tumor protein also know a tumor antigen uniprot name guardian of the genome suppressor or protein be any isoform of a protein encode by homologous gene in various organism such a human and mouse this homolog originally think to be and often speak of a a single protein be crucial in multicellular vertebrate where it prevent cancer formation and thus function a a tumor suppressor a such have be describe a the guardian of the genome because of it role in conserve stability by prevent genome mutation hence be classify a a tumor suppressor gene the name be give in describe the apparent molecular mass analysis indicate that it be a kda protein however the actual mass of the protein base on the sum of mass of the amino acid residue be only kda this difference be due to the high number of proline residue in the protein which slow it migration on thus make it appear heavy than it actually be in addition to the protein the human gene encodes at least protein isoforms range in size from to kda all these protein be call the isoforms the gene be the most frequently mutate gene in human cancer indicate that the gene play a crucial role in prevent cancer formation gene encodes proteins that bind to dna and regulate gene expression to prevent mutation of the genome in human the gene be locate on the short arm of chromosome the gene span kb with a exon and a very long first intron of kb the cod sequence contains five region show a high degree of conservation in vertebrate predominantly in exon and but the sequence find in invertebrate show only distant resemblance to mammalian orthologs have be identify in most mammal for which complete genome data be available in human a common polymorphism involve the substitution of an arginine for a proline at codon position many study have investigate a genetic link between this variation and cancer susceptibility however the result have be controversial for instance a from fail to show a link for cervical cancer a study find that the proline mutation do have a profound effect on pancreatic cancer risk among male a study of arab woman find that proline homozygosity at codon be associate with a decreased risk for breast cancer one study suggest that codon polymorphism and may collectively be associate with cancer susceptibility and that in combination with codon may accelerate the development of cancer in woman a study find that codon polymorphism be associate with an increase risk of lung cancer from find no significant association between codon polymorphism and both colorectal cancer risk and endometrial cancer risk a study of a brazilian birth cohort find an association between the arginine and individual without a family history of cancer another study find that the homozygous genotype be associate with a significantly increase risk for renal cell carcinoma domains an acidic domain tad also know a activation domain which activate transcription factor the contains two complementary transcriptional activation domain with a major one at residue and a minor one at residue specifically involve in the regulation of several gene activation domain important for apoptotic activity residue proline rich domain important for the apoptotic activity of by nuclear exportation via mapk residue central core domain dbd contain one zinc atom and several arginine amino acid residues this region be responsible for bind the nuclear localization signal nls domain residue domain od residue tetramerization be essential for the activity of in vivo involve in downregulation of dna binding of the central domain residue mutation that deactivate in cancer usually occur in the dbd most of these mutation destroy the ability of the protein to bind to it target dna sequence and thus prevents transcriptional activation of these gene a such mutation in the dbd be recessive mutation molecule of with mutation in the od dimerise with and prevent them from activate transcription therefore od mutation have a dominant negative effect on the function of be a labile protein comprise fold and unstructured region that function in a synergistic manner dna damage and repair play a role in regulation or progression through the cell cycle apoptosis and genomic stability by mean of several mechanism it can activate dna repair protein when dna have sustain damage thus it may be an important factor in age it can arrest growth by hold the cell cycle at the regulation point on dna damage it hold the cell here for long enough the dna repair protein will have time to fix the damage and the cell will be allow to continue the cell cycle it can initiate apoptosis program cell death if dna damage prove to be irreparable it be essential for the senescence response to short telomere pathway in a normal cell be inactivate by it negative regulator upon dna damage or other stress various pathway will lead to the dissociation of the and complex once activate will induce a cell cycle arrest to allow either repair and survival of the cell or apoptosis to discard the damage cell how make this choice be currently unknown encode for and hundred of other gene bind to the and complex molecule important for the transition in the cell cycle inhibit their activity when be complexed with the cell can not continue to the next stage of cell division a mutant will no longer bind dna in an effective way and a a consequence the protein will not be available to act a the stop signal for cell division study of human embryonic stem cell hescs commonly describe the nonfunctional axis of the checkpoint pathway with subsequent relevance for cell cycle regulation and the dna damage response ddr importantly mrna be clearly present and upregulated after the ddr in hescs but protein be not detectable in this cell type activate numerous micrornas like and that directly inhibit the expression in hescs the protein bind directly to complexes that drive forward the cell cycle and inhibits their kinase activity thereby cause cell cycle arrest to allow repair to take place can also mediate growth arrest associate with differentiation and a more permanent growth arrest associate with cellular senescence the gene contain several response element that mediate direct binding of the protein result in transcriptional activation of the gene encode the protein the and pathway be link via raise the possibility that the pathway may regulate each other expression can be stimulate by uv light which also cause dna damage in this case can initiate event lead to tan stem cell level of play an important role in the maintenance of stem cell throughout development and the rest of human life in human embryonic stem cell hescs s be maintain at low inactive level this be because activation of lead to rapid differentiation of hescs study have show that knock out delay differentiation and that add cause spontaneous differentiation show how promotes differentiation of hescs and play a key role in cell cycle a a differentiation regulator when become stabilize and activate in hescs it increase to establish a longer this typically lead to abolition of entry which stop the cell cycle in lead to differentiation work in mouse embryonic stem cell have recently show however that the expression of do not necessarily lead to differentiation also activate and which then repress the hescs pluripotency factor far instigate differentiation in adult stem cell regulation be important for maintenance of stemness in adult stem cell niche mechanical signal such a hypoxia affect level of in these niche cell through the hypoxia inducible factor and while stabilizes suppresses it suppression of play important role in cancer stem cell phenotype induce pluripotent stem cell and other stem cell role and behavior such a blastema formation cell with decreased level of have be show to reprogram into stem cell with a much great efficiency than normal cell paper suggest that the lack of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis give more cell the chance to be reprogrammed decreased level of be also show to be a crucial aspect of blastema formation in the leg of salamander regulation be very important in act a a barrier between stem cell and a differentiated stem cell state as well a a barrier between stem cell be functional and be cancerous other apart from the cellular and molecular effect above have a anticancer effect that work by inhibit angiogenesis a tumor grow they need to recruit new blood vessel to supply them and inhibits that by i interfere with regulator of humor hypoxia that also affect angiogenesis such a and ii inhibit the production of angiogenic promote factor and iii directly increase the production of angiogenesis inhibitor such a arresten by regulate leukemia inhibitory factor have be show to facilitate implantation in the mouse and possibly human reproduction becomes activate in response to myriad stressor include but not limited to dna damage induce by either uv ir or chemical agent such a hydrogen peroxide oxidative stress osmotic shock ribonucleotide depletion and deregulate oncogene expression this activation be mark by two major event first the of the protein be increase drastically lead to a quick accumulation of in stressed cell second a conformational change force to be activate a a transcription regulator in these cell the critical event lead to the activation of be the phosphorylation of it domain the transcriptional activation domain contain a large number of phosphorylation site and can be consider a the primary target for protein kinase transduce stress signal the protein kinases that be know to target this transcriptional activation domain of can be roughly divide into two group a first group of protein kinase belong to the mapk family mapk which be know to respond to several type of stress such a membrane damage oxidative stress osmotic shock heat shock etc a second group of protein kinase atr atm and cak be implicate in the genome integrity checkpoint a molecular cascade that detect and respond to several form of dna damage cause by genotoxic stress oncogene also stimulate activation mediate by the protein in unstressed cell level be keep low through a continuous degradation of a protein call also call in human bind to prevent it action and transport it from the nucleus to the cytosol also act a an ubiquitin ligase and covalently attache ubiquitin to and thus mark for degradation by the proteasome however ubiquitylation of be reversible on activation of be also activate set up a feedback loop level can show oscillation or repeat pulse in response to certain stress and these pulse can be important in determine whether the cell survive the stress or die bind to reactivate in situation where function have become inhibit a ubiquitin specific protease or hausp can cleave ubiquitin off thereby protect it from degradation via the ubiquitin ligase pathway this be one mean by which be stabilize in response to oncogenic insult have also be show to deubiquitinate and may be require for the ability of to respond to stress recent research have show that hausp be mainly localize in the nucleus though a fraction of it can be find in the cytoplasm and mitochondria overexpression of hausp result in stabilization however depletion of hausp do not result to a decrease in level but rather increase level due to the fact that hausp bind and deubiquitinates it have be show that hausp be a good binding partner to than in unstressed cell however have be show to be locate in the cytoplasm in unstressed cell and deubiquitinates cytoplasmic reverse ubiquitination follow dna damage translocates to the nucleus and contributes to stability also do not interact with phosphorylation of the end of by the protein kinases disrupt other protein such a be then recruit to and induce a conformational change in which prevents even more phosphorylation also allow for binding of transcriptional coactivators like and pcaf which then acetylate the end of expose the dna bind domain of allow it to activate or repress specific gene deacetylase enzymes such a and can deacetylate lead to an inhibition of apoptosis some oncogene can also stimulate the transcription of protein that bind to and inhibit it activity overview of signal transduction pathway involve in apoptosis a micrograph show cell with abnormal expression brown in a brain tumor immunostain if the gene be damage tumor suppression be severely compromised people who inherit only one functional copy of the gene will most likely develop tumor in early adulthood a disorder know a syndrome the gene can also be modify by mutagen chemical radiation or virus increase the likelihood for uncontrolled cell division more than percent of human tumor contain a mutation or deletion of the gene loss of creates genomic instability that most often result in an aneuploidy phenotype increase the amount of may seem a solution for treatment of tumor or prevention of their spreading this however be not a usable method of treatment since it can cause premature age restore endogenous normal function hold some promise research have show that this restoration can lead to regression of certain cancer cell without damage other cell in the process the way by which tumor regression occur depend mainly on

in theoretical physic field theory be a theoretical framework that combine classical field theory special relativity and quantum mechanic but not general relativity description of gravity qft be use in particle physic to construct physical model of subatomic particle and in condensed matter physic to construct model of quasiparticle qft treat particle a excited state also call quantum of their underlying field which be more fundamental than the particle interaction between particle be describe by interaction term in the lagrangian involve their corresponding field each interaction can be visually represent by feynman diagram accord to perturbation theory in quantum mechanic a a successful theoretical framework today quantum field theory emerge from the work of generation of theoretical physicist span much of the century it development begin in the with the description of interaction between light and electron culminate in the first quantum field theory quantum electrodynamics a major theoretical obstacle soon follow with the appearance and persistence of various infinity in perturbative calculation a problem only resolve in the with the invention of the renormalization procedure a second major barrier come with qft apparent inability to describe the weak and strong interaction to the point where some theorist call for the abandonment of the field theoretic approach the development of gauge theory and the completion of the standard model in the lead to a renaissance of quantum field theory theoretical background magnetic field line visualize use iron filing when a piece of paper be sprinkle with iron filing and place above a bar magnet the filing align accord to the direction of the magnetic field form arcs quantum field theory be the result of the combination of classical field theory quantum mechanic and special relativity a brief overview of these theoretical precursor be in order the early successful classical field theory be one that emerge from newton law of universal gravitation despite the complete absence of the concept of field from his treatise philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica the force of gravity a describe by newton be an action at a distance it effect on faraway object be instantaneous no matter the distance in an exchange of letter with richard bentley however newton state that it be inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should without the mediation of something else which be not material operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact it be not until the century that mathematical physicist discover a convenient description of gravity base on field a numerical quantity a vector assign to every point in space indicate the action of gravity on any particle at that point however this be consider merely a mathematical trick field begin to take on an existence of their own with the development of electromagnetism in the century michael faraday coin the english term field in he introduce field a property of space even when it be devoid of matter have physical effect he argue against action at a distance and propose that interaction between object occur via line of force this description of field remain to this day the theory of classical electromagnetism be complete in with maxwell equation which describe the relationship between the electric field the magnetic field electric current and electric charge maxwell equation imply the existence of electromagnetic wave a phenomenon whereby electric and magnetic field propagate from one spatial point to another at a finite speed which turn out to be the speed of light be thus conclusively refute despite the enormous success of classical electromagnetism it be unable to account for the discrete line in atomic spectrum nor for the distribution of blackbody radiation in different wavelength max planck study of blackbody radiation mark the beginning of quantum mechanic he treat atom which absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation a tiny oscillator with the crucial property that their energy can only take on a series of discrete rather than continuous value these be know a quantum harmonic oscillator this process of restrict energy to discrete value be call quantization building on this idea albert einstein propose in an explanation for the photoelectric effect that light be compose of individual packet of energy call photon the quantum of light this imply that the electromagnetic radiation while be wave in the classical electromagnetic field also exist in the form of particle in niels bohr introduce the bohr model of atomic structure wherein electron within atom can only take on a series of discrete rather than continuous energy this be another example of quantization the bohr model successfully explain the discrete nature of atomic spectral line in louis de broglie propose the hypothesis of duality that microscopic particle exhibit both and property under different circumstance unite these scatter idea a coherent discipline quantum mechanic be formulate between and with important contribution from de broglie werner heisenberg max bear erwin schrödinger paul dirac and wolfgang pauli in the same year a his paper on the photoelectric effect einstein publish his theory of special relativity build on maxwell electromagnetism new rule call lorentz transformation be give for the way time and space coordinate of an event change under change in the observer velocity and the distinction between time and space be blur it be propose that all physical law must be the same for observer at different velocity that physical law be invariant under lorentz transformation two difficulty remain observationally the schrödinger equation underlie quantum mechanic could explain the stimulated emission of radiation from atom where an electron emit a new photon under the action of an external electromagnetic field but it be unable to explain spontaneous emission where an electron spontaneously decrease in energy and emit a photon even without the action of an external electromagnetic field theoretically the schrödinger equation could not describe photon and be inconsistent with the principle of special relativity it treat time a an ordinary number while promote spatial coordinate to linear operator quantum electrodynamics quantum field theory naturally begin with the study of electromagnetic interaction a the electromagnetic field be the only known classical field a of the through the work of born heisenberg and pascual jordan in a quantum theory of the free electromagnetic field one with no interaction with matter be develop via canonical quantization by treat the electromagnetic field a a set of quantum harmonic oscillator with the exclusion of interaction however such a theory be yet incapable of make quantitative prediction about the real world in his seminal paper the quantum theory of the emission and absorption of radiation dirac coin the term quantum electrodynamics qed a theory that add upon the term describe the free electromagnetic field an additional interaction term between electric current density and the electromagnetic vector potential use perturbation theory he successfully explain the phenomenon of spontaneous emission accord to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanic quantum harmonic oscillator can not remain stationary but they have a minimum energy and must always be oscillate even in the low energy state the ground state therefore even in a perfect vacuum there remain an oscillating electromagnetic field have energy it be this quantum fluctuation of electromagnetic field in the vacuum that stimulate the spontaneous emission of radiation by electron in atom dirac theory be hugely successful in explain both the emission and absorption of radiation by atom by apply perturbation theory it be able to account for the scattering of photon resonance fluorescence as well a compton scatter nonetheless the application of perturbation theory be plague with problematic infinity in calculation in dirac write down a wave equation that describe relativistic electron the dirac equation it have the following important consequence the spin of an electron be the electron g be it lead to the correct sommerfeld formula for the fine structure of the hydrogen atom and it could be use to derive the formula for relativistic compton scatter although the result be fruitful the theory also apparently imply the existence of negative energy state which would cause atom to be unstable since they could always decay to lower energy state by the emission of radiation the prevailing view at the time be that the world be compose of two very different ingredient material particle such a electron and quantum field such a photon material particle be consider to be eternal with their physical state describe by the probability of find each particle in any give region of space or range of velocity on the other hand photon be consider merely the excited state of the underlie quantized electromagnetic field and could be freely create or destroy it be between and that jordan eugene wigner heisenberg pauli and enrico fermi discover that material particle could also be see a excited state of quantum field just a photon be excited state of the quantized electromagnetic field so each type of particle have it corresponding quantum field an electron field a proton field etc give enough energy it would now be possible to create material particle build on this idea fermi propose in an explanation for β decay know a fermi interaction atomic nucleus do not contain electron per se but in the process of decay an electron be create out of the surround electron field analogous to the photon create from the surround electromagnetic field in the radiative decay of an excited atom it be realize in by dirac and others that negative energy state imply by the dirac equation could be remove by assume the existence of particle with the same mass a electron but opposite electric charge this not only ensure the stability of atom but it be also the first proposal of the existence of antimatter indeed the evidence for positron be discover in by carl david anderson in cosmic ray with enough energy such a by absorb a photon an pair could be create a process call pair production the reverse process annihilation could also occur with the emission of a photon this show that particle number need not be fix during an interaction historically however positron be at first thought of a hole in an infinite electron sea rather than a new kind of particle and this theory be refer to a the dirac hole theory qft naturally incorporate antiparticle in it formalism infinity and renormalization robert oppenheimer show in that perturbative calculation in qed always result in infinite quantity such a the electron and the vacuum energy of the electron and photon field suggest that the computational method at the time could not properly deal with interaction involve photon with extremely high momentum it be not until year later that a systematic approach to remove such infinity be develop a series of paper be publish between and by ernst stueckelberg that establish a relativistically invariant formulation of qft in stueckelberg also independently develop a complete renormalization procedure unfortunately such achievement be not understood and recognize by the theoretical community face with these infinity john archibald wheeler and heisenberg propose in and respectively to supplant the problematic qft with the theory since the specific detail of microscopic interaction be inaccessible to observations the theory should only attempt to describe the relationship between a small number of observables the energy of an atom in an interaction rather than be concern with the microscopic minutia of the interaction in richard feynman and wheeler daringly suggest abandon qft altogether and propose a the mechanism of particle interaction in willis lamb and robert retherford measure the minute difference in the s and p energy level of the hydrogen atom also call the lamb shift by ignore the contribution of photon whose energy exceed the electron mass hans bethe successfully estimate the numerical value of the lamb shift subsequently norman myles kroll lamb james bruce french and victor weisskopf again confirm this value use an approach in which infinity cancel other infinity to result in finite quantity however this method be clumsy and unreliable and could not be generalize to other calculation the breakthrough eventually come around when a more robust method for eliminate infinity be develop by julian schwinger feynman freeman dyson and shinichiro tomonaga the main idea be to replace the initial bare parameter mass electric charge etc which have no physical meaning by their finite measure value to cancel the apparently infinite parameter one have to introduce additional infinite counterterms into the lagrangian this systematic computational procedure be know a renormalization and can be apply to arbitrary order in perturbation theory by apply the renormalization procedure calculation be finally make to explain the electron anomalous magnetic moment the deviation of the electron g from and vacuum polarisation these result agree with experimental measurement to a remarkable degree thus mark the end of a war against infinity at the same time feynman introduce the path integral formulation of quantum mechanic and feynman diagram the latter can be use to visually and intuitively organise and to help compute term in the perturbative expansion each diagram can be interpret a path of particle in an interaction with each vertex and line have a corresponding mathematical expression and the product of these expression give the scatter amplitude of the interaction represent by the diagram it be with the invention of the renormalization procedure and feynman diagram that qft finally arose a a complete theoretical framework give the tremendous success of qed many theorist believe in the few year after that qft could soon provide an understanding of all microscopic phenomena not only the interaction between photon electron and positron contrary to this optimism qft enter yet another period of depression that last for almost two decade the first obstacle be the limited applicability of the renormalization procedure in perturbative calculation in qed all infinite quantity could be eliminate by redefine a small finite number of physical quantity namely the mass and charge of the electron dyson prove in that this be only possible for a small class of theory call renormalizable theory of which qed be an example however most theory include the fermi theory of the weak interaction be any perturbative calculation in these theory beyond the first order would result in infinity that could not be remove by redefine a finite number of physical quantity the second major problem stem from the limited validity of the feynman diagram method which be base on a series expansion in perturbation theory in order for the series to converge and calculation to be a good approximation the coupling constant in which the series be expand must be a sufficiently small number the couple constant in qed be the constant which be small enough that only the simple low order feynman diagram need to be consider in realistic calculation in contrast the couple constant in the strong interaction be roughly of the order of one making complicate high order feynman diagram just as important a simple one there be thus no way of derive reliable quantitative prediction for the strong interaction use perturbative qft method with these difficulty loom many theorist begin to turn away from qft some focus on symmetry principle and conservation law while others pick up the old theory of wheeler and heisenberg qft be use heuristically a guide principle but not a a basis for quantitative calculation standard model elementary particle of the standard model six type of matter quark four type of gauge boson that carry fundamental interaction as well a the higgs boson which endow elementary particle with mass in yang and robert mill generalise the local symmetry of qed lead to gauge theory also know a theory which be base on more complicated local symmetry group in qed electrically charge particle interact via the exchange of photon while in gauge theory particle carry a new type of charge interact via the exchange of massless gauge boson unlike photon these gauge boson themselves carry charge sheldon glashow develop a gauge theory that unify the electromagnetic and weak interaction in in abdus salam and john clive ward arrive at the same theory through a different path this theory nevertheless be peter higgs robert brout and françois englert propose in that the gauge symmetry in theory could be break by a mechanism call spontaneous symmetry break through which originally massless gauge boson could acquire mass by combine the early theory of glashow salam and ward with the idea of spontaneous symmetry break steven weinberg write down in a theory describe electroweak interaction between all lepton and the effect of the higgs boson his theory be at first mostly ignore until it be bring back to light in by gerard hooft proof that gauge theory be renormalizable the electroweak theory of weinberg and salam be extend from lepton to quark in by glashow john iliopoulos and luciano maiani mark it completion harald fritzsch murray and heinrich leutwyler discover in that certain phenomenon involve the strong interaction could also be explain by gauge theory quantum chromodynamics qcd be bear in david gross frank wilczek and hugh david politzer show that gauge theory be asymptotically free meaning that under renormalization the couple constant of the strong interaction decrease a the interaction energy increase similar discovery have be make numerous time previously but they have be largely ignore therefore at least in interaction the couple constant in qcd becomes sufficiently small to warrant a perturbative series expansion make quantitative prediction for the strong interaction possible these theoretical breakthrough bring about a renaissance in qft the full theory which include the electroweak theory and chromodynamics be refer to today a the standard model of elementary particle the standard model successfully describe all fundamental interaction except gravity and it many prediction have be meet with remarkable experimental confirmation in subsequent decade the higgs boson central to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking be finally detect in at cern mark the complete verification of the existence of all constituent of the standard model other development the saw the development of method in gauge theory the monopole be discover by hooft and alexander polyakov flux tube by holger bech nielsen and poul olesen and instantons by polyakov et these object be inaccessible through perturbation theory supersymmetry also appear in the same period the first supersymmetric qft in four dimension be build by yuri golfand and evgeny likhtman in but their result fail to garner widespread interest due to the iron curtain supersymmetry only take off in the theoretical community after the work of julius wess and bruno zumino in among the four fundamental interaction gravity remain the only one that lack a consistent qft description various attempt at a theory of quantum gravity lead to the development of string theory itself a type of qft with conformal symmetry joël scherk and john schwarz first propose in that string theory could be the quantum theory of gravity condense matter physic although quantum field theory arose from the study of interaction between elementary particle it have be successfully apply to other physical system particularly to system in condensed matter physic historically the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking be a result of yoichiro nambu application of superconductor theory to elementary particle while the concept of renormalization come out of the study of phase transition in matter soon after the introduction of photon einstein perform the quantization procedure on vibration in a crystal leading to the first quasiparticle phonons lev landau claim that excitation in many condensed matter system could be describe in term of interaction between a set of quasiparticle the feynman diagram method of qft be naturally well suit to the analysis of various phenomenon in condensed matter system gauge theory be use to describe the quantization of magnetic flux in superconductors the resistivity in the quantum hall effect as well a the relation between frequency and voltage in the ac josephson effect for simplicity natural unit be use in the following section in which the reduce planck constant and the speed of light be both set to one classical field a classical field be a function of spatial and time coordinate example include the gravitational field in newtonian gravity and the electric field and magnetic field in classical electromagnetism a classical field can be think of a a numerical quantity assign to every point in space that change in time hence it have infinitely many degree of freedom many phenomenon exhibit quantum mechanical property can not be explain by classical field alone phenomena such a the photoelectric effect be best explain by discrete particle photon rather than a spatially continuous field the goal of quantum field theory be to describe various quantum mechanical phenomenon use a modified concept of field canonical quantisation and path integral be two common formulation of qft to motivate the fundamental of qft an overview of classical field theory be in order the simple classical field be a real scalar field a real number at every point in space that change in time it be denote a where be the position vector and be the time suppose the lagrangian of the field be where be the of the field be the gradient operator and be a real parameter the mass of the field apply the equation on the lagrangian we obtain the equation of motion for the field which describe the way it vary in time and space this be know a the equation the equation be a wave equation so it solution can be express a a sum of normal mode obtain via fourier transform a follow where be a complex number normalise by convention denotes complex conjugation and be the frequency of the normal mode thus each normal mode correspond to a single can be see a a classical harmonic oscillator with frequency canonical quantisation the quantisation procedure for the above classical field be analogous to the promotion of a classical harmonic oscillator to a quantum harmonic oscillator the displacement of a classical harmonic oscillator be describe by where be a complex number normalise by convention and be the oscillator frequency note that be the displacement of a particle in simple harmonic motion from the equilibrium position which should not be confuse with the spatial label of a field for a quantum harmonic oscillator be promote to a linear operator complex number and be replace by the annihilation operator and the creation operator respectively where denote hermitian conjugation the commutation relation between the two be the vacuum state which be the low energy state be define by any quantum state of a single harmonic oscillator can be obtain from by successively apply the creation operator by the same token the aforementioned real scalar field which correspond to in the single harmonic oscillator be also promote to an operator while and be replace by the annihilation operator and the creation operator for a particular respectively their commutation relation be where be the dirac delta function the vacuum state be define by any quantum state of the field can be obtain from by successively apply creation operator although the field appear in the lagrangian be spatially continuous the quantum state of the field be discrete while the state space of a single quantum harmonic oscillator contain all the discrete energy state of one oscillate particle the state space of a quantum field contain the discrete energy level of an arbitrary number of particle the latter space be know a a fock space which can account for the fact that particle number be not fix in relativistic quantum system the process of quantise an arbitrary number of particle instead of a single particle be often also call second quantisation the preceding procedure be a direct application of quantum mechanic and can be use to quantise complex scalar field dirac field vector field the electromagnetic field and even string however creation and annihilation operator be only well define in the simplest theory that contain no interaction free theory in the case of the real scalar field the existence of these operator be a consequence of the decomposition of solution of the classical equation of motion into a sum of normal mode to perform calculation on any realistic interacting theory perturbation theory would be necessary the lagrangian of any quantum field in nature would contain interaction term in addition to the free theory term for example a quartic interaction term could be introduce to the lagrangian of the real scalar field where be a spacetime index etc the summation over the index have be omit follow the einstein notation if the parameter be sufficiently small then the interact theory describe by the above lagrangian can be consider a a small perturbation from the free theory path integrals the path integral formulation of qft be concern with the direct computation of the scatter amplitude of a certain interaction process rather than the establishment of operator and state space to calculate the probability amplitude for a system to evolve from some initial state at time to some final state at the total time be divide into small interval the overall amplitude be the product of the amplitude of evolution within each interval integrate over all intermediate state let be the hamiltonian generator of time evolution then take the limit the above product of integral become the feynman path integral where be the lagrangian involve and it derivative with respect to spatial and time coordinate obtain from the hamiltonian via legendre transform the initial and final condition of the path integral be respectively in other word the overall amplitude be the sum over the amplitude of every possible path between the initial and final state where the amplitude of a path be give by the exponential in the integrand correlation function now we assume that the theory contain interaction whose lagrangian term be a small perturbation from the free theory in calculation one often encounter such expression where and be position be the time order operator namely it order and accord to their late time on the left and early time on the right and be the ground state vacuum state of the interact theory this expression know a the correlation function or the green function represent the probability amplitude for the field to propagate from to in canonical quantisation the correlation function can be write a where be an infinitesimal number be the field operator under the free theory and be the interaction hamiltonian term for the theory it be since be a small parameter the exponential function can be expand into a taylor series in and computed term by term this equation be useful in that it express the field operator and ground state in the interacting theory which be difficult to define in term of their counterpart in the free theory which be well define in the path integral formulation the correlation function can be write a where be the lagrangian density a in the previous paragraph the exponential factor involve the interaction term can also be expand a a series in accord to wick theorem any correlation function in the free theory can be write a a sum of product of correlation function for example since correlation function in the interacting theory can be express in term of those in the free theory only the latter need to be evaluate in order to calculate all physical quantity in the perturbative interacting theory either through canonical quantisation or path integral one can obtain this be know a the feynman propagator for the real scalar field feynman diagram correlation function in the interacting theory can be write a a perturbation series each term in the series be a product of feynman propagator in the free theory and can be represent visually by a feynman diagram for example the term in the correlation function in the theory be after apply wick theorem one of the term be whose correspond feynman diagram be every point correspond to a single field factor point label with and be call external point while those in the interior be call internal point or vertex there be one in this diagram the value of the corresponding term can be obtain from the diagram by follow feynman rule assign to every vertex and the feynman propagator to every line with end point and the product of factor correspond to every element in the diagram divide by the symmetry factor for this diagram give the expression for the term in the perturbation series in order to compute the correlation function to the order list all valid feynman diagram with external point and or few vertex and then use feynman rule to obtain the expression for each term to be precise be equal to the sum of expression correspond to all connect diagram with external point connect diagram be those in which every vertex be connect to an external point through line component that be totally disconnect from external line be sometimes call vacuum bubble in the interaction theory discuss above every vertex must have four leg in realistic application the scatter amplitude of a certain interaction or the decay rate of a particle can be compute from the which itself can be find use the feynman diagram method feynman diagram devoid of loop be call diagram which describe the interaction process those contain loop be refer to a diagram which describe contribution or radiative correction to the interaction line whose end point be vertex can be think of a the propagation of virtual particle renormalisation feynman rule can be use to directly evaluate diagram however naïve computation of loop diagram such a the one show above will result in divergent momentum integral which seem to imply that almost all term in the perturbative expansion be infinite the renormalisation procedure be a systematic process for remove such infinity parameter appear in the lagrangian such a the mass and the coupling constant have no physical meaning and the field strength be not experimentally measurable quantity and be refer to here a the bare mass bare couple constant and bare field respectively the physical mass and coupling constant be measure in some interaction process and be generally different from the bare quantity while compute physical quantity from this interaction process one may limit the domain of divergent momentum integral to be below some momentum obtain expression for the physical quantity and then take the limit this be an example of regularisation a class of method to treat divergence in qft with be the regulator the approach illustrate above be call bare perturbation theory a calculation involve only the bare quantity such a mass and couple constant a different approach call renormalised perturbation theory be to use physically meaningful quantity from the very begin in the case of theory the field strength be first redefine where be the bare field be the renormalised field and be a constant to be determine the lagrangian density become where and be the experimentally measurable renormalised mass and couple constant respectively and be constant to be determine the first three term be the lagrangian density write in term of the renormalised quantity while the latter three term be refer to as counterterms a the lagrangian now contain more term so the feynman diagram should include additional element each with their own feynman rule the procedure be outline a follow first select a regularisation scheme such a the regularisation introduce above or dimensional regularization call the regulator compute feynman diagram in which divergent term will depend on then define and such that feynman diagram for the counterterms will exactly cancel the divergent term in the normal feynman diagram when the limit be take in this way meaningful finite quantity be obtain it be only possible to eliminate all infinity to obtain a finite result in renormalisable theory whereas in theory infinity can not be remove by the redefinition of a small number of parameter the standard model of elementary particle be a renormalisable qft while quantum gravity be renormalisation group the renormalisation group develop by kenneth wilson be a mathematical apparatus use to study the change in physical parameter coefficient in the lagrangian a the system be view at different scale the way in which each parameter change with scale be describe by it β function correlation function which underlie quantitative physical prediction change with scale accord to the equation a an example the coupling constant in qed namely the elementary charge have the following β function where be the energy scale under which the measurement of be perform this differential equation implies that the observed elementary charge increase a the scale increase the renormalized coupling constant which change with the energy scale be also call the run coupling constant the coupling constant in quantum chromodynamics a gauge theory base on the symmetry group have the following β function where be the number of quark flavour in the case where the standard model have the coupling constant decrease a the energy scale increase hence while the strong interaction be strong at low energy it become very weak in interaction a phenomenon know a asymptotic freedom conformal field theory cfts be special qfts that admit conformal symmetry they be insensitive to change in the scale a all their coupling constant have vanish β function the converse be not true however the vanishing of all β function do not imply conformal symmetry of the theory example include string theory and supersymmetric theory accord to wilson picture every qft be fundamentally accompany by it energy that the theory be no longer valid at energy high than and all degree of freedom above the scale be to be omit for example the could be the inverse of the atomic spacing in a condensed matter system and in elementary particle physic it could be associate with the fundamental graininess of spacetime cause by quantum fluctuation in gravity the scale of theory of particle interaction lie far beyond current experiment even if the theory be very complicate at that scale as long a it coupling be sufficiently weak it must be describe at low energy by a renormalisable effective field theory the difference between renormalisable and theory be that the former be insensitive to detail at high energy whereas the latter do depend of them accord to this view theory be to be see a effective theory of a more fundamental theory the failure to remove the from calculation in such a theory merely indicate that new physical phenomenon appear at scale above where a new theory be necessary other theory the quantisation and renormalisation procedure outline in the preceding section be perform for the free theory and theory of the real scalar field a similar process can be do for other type of field include the complex scalar field the vector field and the dirac field as well a other type of interaction term include the electromagnetic interaction and the yukawa interaction a an example quantum electrodynamics contain a dirac field represent the electron field and a vector field represent the electromagnetic field photon field despite it name the quantum electromagnetic field actually correspond to the classical electromagnetic rather than the classical electric and magnetic field the full qed lagrangian density be where be dirac matrix and be the electromagnetic field strength the parameter in this theory be the bare electron mass and the bare elementary charge the first and second term in the lagrangian density correspond to the free dirac field and free vector field respectively the last term describe the interaction between the electron and photon field which be treat a a perturbation from the free theory show above be an example of a feynman diagram in qed it describe an electron and a positron annihilate create an photon and then decay into a new pair of electron and positron time run from leave to right arrow point forward in time represent the propagation of positron while those point backward in time represent the propagation of electron a wavy line represent the propagation of a photon each vertex in qed feynman diagram must have an incoming and an outgoing fermion leg as well a a photon leg gauge symmetry if the follow transformation to the field be perform at every spacetime point a local transformation then the qed lagrangian remain unchanged or invariant where be any function of spacetime coordinate if a theory lagrangian or more precisely the action be invariant under a certain local transformation then the transformation be refer to a a gauge symmetry of the theory gauge symmetry form a group at every spacetime point in the case of qed the successive application of two different local symmetry transformation and be yet another symmetry transformation for any be an element of the group thus qed be say to have gauge symmetry the photon field may be refer to a the gauge boson be an abelian group meaning that the result be the same regardless of the order in which it element be apply qfts can also be build on group give rise to gauge theory also know a theory quantum chromodynamics which describe the strong interaction be a gauge theory with an gauge symmetry it contain three dirac field represent quark field as well a eight vector field represent gluon field which be the gauge boson the qcd lagrangian density be where be the gauge covariant derivative where be the coupling constant be the eight generator of in the fundamental representation matrix and be the structure constant of repeated index be implicitly sum over follow einstein notation this lagrangian be invariant under the transformation where be an element of at every spacetime point the precede discussion of symmetry be on the level of the lagrangian in other word these be classical symmetry after quantisation some theory will no longer exhibit their classical symmetry a phenomenon call anomaly for instance in the path integral formulation despite the invariance of the lagrangian density under a certain local transformation of the field the measure of the path integral may change for a theory describe nature to be consistent it must not contain any anomaly in it gauge symmetry the standard model of elementary particle be a gauge theory base on the group in which all anomaly exactly cancel the theoretical foundation of general relativity the equivalence principle can also be understood a a form of gauge symmetry make general relativity a gauge theory base on the lorentz group noether theorem state that every continuous symmetry the parameter in the symmetry transformation be continuous rather than discrete lead to a corresponding conservation law for example the symmetry of qed implies charge conservation gauge transformation do not relate distinct quantum state rather it relate two equivalent mathematical description of the same quantum state a an example the photon field be a have four apparent degree of freedom but the actual state of a photon be describe by it two degree of freedom correspond to the polarisation the remain two degree of freedom be say to be redundant apparently different way of writing can be relate to each other by a gauge transformation and in fact describe the same state of the photon field in this sense gauge invariance be not a real symmetry but be a reflection of the redundancy of the chosen mathematical description to account for the gauge redundancy in the path integral formulation one must perform the gauge fix procedure in gauge theory such a procedure introduce new field call ghost particle correspond to the ghost field be call ghost particle which can not be detect externally a more rigorous generalisation of the procedure be give by brst quantization spontaneous symmetry break spontaneous symmetry breaking be a mechanism whereby the symmetry of the lagrangian be violate by the system describe by it to illustrate the mechanism consider a linear sigma model contain real scalar field describe by the lagrangian density where and be real parameter the theory admit an global symmetry the low energy state ground state or vacuum state of the classical theory be any uniform field satisfy without loss of generality let the ground state be in the direction the original field can be rewrite a and the original lagrangian density a where the original global symmetry be no longer manifest leave only the subgroup the large symmetry before spontaneous symmetry breaking be say to be hide or spontaneously broken goldstone theorem state that under spontaneous symmetry break every broken continuous global symmetry lead to a massless field call the goldstone boson in the above example have continuous symmetry the dimension of it lie algebra while have the number of broken symmetry be their difference which correspond to the massless field on the other hand when a gauge a oppose to global symmetry be spontaneously break the result goldstone boson be eat by the corresponding gauge boson by become an additional degree of freedom for the gauge boson the goldstone boson equivalence theorem state that at high energy the amplitude for emission or absorption of a longitudinally polarise massive gauge boson become equal to the amplitude for emission or absorption of the goldstone boson that be eat by the gauge boson in the qft of ferromagnetism spontaneous symmetry breaking can explain the alignment of magnetic dipole at low temperature in the standard model of elementary particle the w and z boson which would otherwise be massless a a result of gauge symmetry acquire mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the higgs boson a process call the higgs mechanism supersymmetry all experimentally know symmetry in nature relate boson to boson and fermion to fermion theorist have hypothesise the existence of a type of symmetry call supersymmetry that relate boson and fermion the standard model obeys poincaré symmetry whose generator be spacetime translation and lorentz transformation in addition to these generator supersymmetry in include additional generator call supercharges which themselves transform a weyl fermion the symmetry group generate by all these generator be know a the group in general there can be more than one set of supersymmetry generator which generate the corresponding supersymmetry supersymmetry and so on supersymmetry can also be construct in other dimension most notably in dimension for it application in superstring theory the lagrangian of a supersymmetric theory must be invariant under the action of the group examples of such theory include minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm supersymmetric theory and superstring theory in a supersymmetric theory every fermion have a bosonic superpartner and vice versa if supersymmetry be promote to a local symmetry then the resultant gauge theory be an extension of general relativity call supergravity supersymmetry be a potential solution to many current problem in physic for example the hierarchy problem of the standard model why the mass of the higgs boson be not radiatively correct under renormalisation to a very high scale such a the grand unified scale or the planck scale can be resolve by relate the higgs field and it superpartner the higgsino radiative correction due to higgs boson loop in feynman diagram be cancel by correspond higgsino loop supersymmetry also offer answer to the grand unification of all gauge couple constant in the standard model as well a the nature of dark matter nevertheless experiment have yet to provide evidence for the existence of supersymmetric particle if supersymmetry be a true symmetry of nature

the be the body part that provide support shape and protection to the soft tissue and delicate organ of animal there be several different skeletal type the exoskeleton which be the stable outer shell of an organism the endoskeleton which form the support structure inside the body the hydroskeleton a flexible skeleton support by fluid pressure and the cytoskeleton present in the cytoplasm of all cell include bacteria and archaea the term come there be two major type of skeleton solid and fluid solid skeleton can be internal call an endoskeleton or external call an exoskeleton and may be far classify a or fluid skeleton be always internal exoskeleton of an ant exoskeleton be external and be find in many invertebrate they enclose and protect the soft tissue and organ of the body some kind of exoskeleton undergo periodic moulting or ecdysis a the animal grows a be the case in many arthropod include insect and crustaceans the exoskeleton of insect be not only a form of protection but also serve a a surface for muscle attachment a a watertight protection against dry and a a sense organ to interact with the environment the shell of mollusk also perform all of the same function except that in most case it do not contain sense organ an external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal so on land organism that have an exoskeleton be mostly relatively small somewhat large aquatic animal can support an exoskeleton because weight be less of a consideration underwater the southern giant clam a specie of extremely large saltwater clam in the pacific ocean have a shell that be massive in both size and weight aruanus be a specie of sea snail with a very large shell endoskeleton of a bat the endoskeleton be the internal support structure of an animal compose of mineralized tissue and be typical of vertebrate endoskeleton vary in complexity from function purely for support a in the case of sponge to serve a an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmit muscular force a true endoskeleton be derive from mesodermal tissue such a skeleton be present in echinoderm and chordate pliant skeleton be capable of movement thus when stress be apply to the skeletal structure it deform and then revert to it original shape this skeletal structure be use in some invertebrate for instance in the hinge of bivalve shell or the mesoglea of cnidarian such a jellyfish pliant skeleton be beneficial because only muscle contraction be need to bend the skeleton upon muscle relaxation the skeleton will return to it original shape cartilage be one material that a pliant skeleton may be compose of but most pliant skeleton be form from a mixture of protein polysaccharide and water for additional structure or protection pliant skeleton may be support by rigid skeleton organisms that have pliant skeleton typically live in water which support body structure in the absence of a rigid skeleton rigid skeleton be not capable of movement when stress create a strong support system most common in terrestrial animal such a skeleton type use by animal that live in water be more for protection such a barnacle and snail shell or for animal that require additional support of musculature need for swim through water rigid skeleton be form from material include chitin in arthropod calcium compound such a calcium carbonate in stony coral and mollusk and silicate for diatom and radiolarians the cytoskeleton gr cell be use to stabilize and preserve the form of the cell it be a dynamic structure that maintain cell shape protect the cell enable cellular motion use structure such a flagellum cilium and lamellipodia and play important role in both intracellular transport the movement of vesicle and organelle for example and cellular division hydrostatic skeleton hydroskeleton a hydrostatic skeleton be a soft tissue structure fill with liquid under pressure surround by muscle longitudinal and circular muscle around their body sector allow movement by alternate lengthening and contraction along their length a common example of this be the earthworm the endoskeleton of echinoderm and some other invertebrate such a jellyfish and earthworm be also term hydrostatic a body cavity the coelom be fill with coelomic fluid and the pressure from this fluid act together with the surround muscle to change the organism shape and produce movement the skeleton of sponge consists of microscopic calcareous or silicious spicule the demosponges include of all specie of sponge their skeleton be make of spicule consist of fiber of the protein spongin the mineral silica or both where spicule of silica be present they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar glass sponge the skeleton of the echinoderm which include among other thing the starfish be compose of calcite and a small amount of magnesium oxide it lie below the epidermis in the mesoderm and be within cell cluster of cell this structure form be porous and therefore firm and at the same time light it coalesce into small calcareous ossicle bony plate which can grow in all direction and thus can replace the loss of a body part connect by joint the individual skeletal part can be move by the muscle pithecometra from thomas huxley evidence a to man place in nature the compare skeleton of ape to human in most vertebrate the main skeletal component be refer to a bone these bone compose a unique skeletal system for each type of animal another important component be cartilage which in mammal be find mainly in the joint area in other animal such a the cartilaginous fish which include the shark the skeleton be compose entirely of cartilage the segmental pattern of the skeleton be present in all vertebrate mammal bird fish reptile and amphibian with basic unit be repeat this segmental pattern be particularly evident in the vertebral column and the ribcage bone in addition to support the body also serve at the cellular level a calcium and phosphate storage the skeleton which form the support structure inside the fish be either made of cartilage a in the chondrichthyes or bone a in the osteichthyes the main skeletal element be the vertebral column compose of articulate vertebra which be lightweight yet strong the rib attach to the spine and there be no limb or limb girdle they be support only by the muscle the main external feature of the fish the fin be compose of either bony or soft spine call ray which with the exception of the caudal fin tail fin have no direct connection with the spine they be support by the muscle which compose the main part of the trunk the bird skeleton be highly adapt for flight it be extremely lightweight yet still strong enough to withstand the stress of take off fly and land one key adaptation be the fusing of bone into single ossification such a the pygostyle because of this bird usually have a small number of bone than other terrestrial vertebrate bird also lack teeth or even a true jaw instead have evolve a beak which be far more lightweight the beak of many baby bird have a projection call an egg tooth which facilitate their exit from the amniotic egg californian sea lion to facilitate the movement of marine mammal in water the hind leg be either lose altogether a in the whale and manatee or unite in a single tail fin a in the pinniped seal in the whale the cervical vertebra be typically fuse an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming of skeleton by leonardo da vinci the skeleton consist of both fuse and individual bone support and supplement by ligament tendon muscle and cartilage it serve a a scaffold which support organ anchor muscle and protects organ such a the brain lung heart and spinal cord although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly find in bone the teeth be usually consider a member of the skeletal system the big bone in the body be the femur in the upper leg and the small be the stapes bone in the middle ear in an adult the skeleton comprise around of the total body weight and half of this weight be water fused bone include those of the pelvis and the cranium not all bone be interconnect directly there be three bone in each middle ear call the ossicle that articulate only with each other the hyoid bone which be locate in the neck and serve a the point of attachment for the tongue do not articulate with any other bone in the body be support by muscle and ligament there be bone in the adult human skeleton although this number depend on whether the pelvic bone the hip bone on each side be count a one or three bone on each side ilium ischium and pubis whether the coccyx or tail bone be count a one or four separate bone and do not count the variable wormian bone between skull suture similarly the sacrum be usually count a a single bone rather than five fused vertebra there be also a variable number of small sesamoid bone commonly find in tendon the patella or kneecap on each side be an example of a large sesamoid bone the patella be count in the total a they be constant the number of bone varies between individual and with age newborn baby have over bone some of which fuse together these bone be organize into a longitudinal axis the axial skeleton to which the appendicular skeleton be attach the human skeleton take year before it be fully develop and the bone contain marrow which produce blood cell there exist several general difference between the male and female skeleton the male skeleton for example be generally large and heavy than the female skeleton in the female skeleton the bone of the skull be generally less angular the female skeleton also have wider and short breastbone and slimmer wrist there exist significant difference between the male and female pelvis which be relate to the female pregnancy and childbirth capability the female pelvis be wide and shallow than the male pelvis female pelvis also have an enlarge pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet the angle between the pubic bone be know to be sharper in male which result in a more circular narrower and near pelvis bone be rigid organ that form part of the endoskeleton of vertebrate they function to move support and protect the various organ of the body produce red and white blood cell and store mineral bone tissue be a type of dense connective tissue bone have a variety of shape with a complex internal and external structure they be also lightweight yet strong and hard one of the type of tissue that make up bone tissue be mineralize tissue and this give it rigidity and a internal structure other type of tissue find in bone include marrow endosteum and periosteum nerve blood vessel and cartilage during embryonic development the precursor to bone development be cartilage that mostly become replace by bone after flesh such a muscle have form around it cartilage be a stiff and inflexible connective tissue find in many area include the joint between bone the rib cage the ear the nose the elbow the knee the ankle the bronchial tube and the intervertebral disc it be not as hard and rigid a bone but be stiff and less flexible than muscle cartilage be compose of specialized cell call chondrocytes that produce a large amount of extracellular matrix compose of type ii collagen except fibrocartilage which also contain type i collagen fiber abundant ground substance rich in proteoglycans and elastin fiber cartilage be classify in three type elastic cartilage hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage which differ in the relative amount of these three main component unlike other connective tissue cartilage do not contain blood vessel the chondrocytes be supply by diffusion help by the pump action generate by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage thus compare to other connective tissue cartilage grows and repair more slowly in western culture the human skeleton be oftentimes see a a fearful symbol of death and the paranormal it be a popular motif in the holiday halloween as well a day of the dead skeleton can also be find in movie skeleton in movie can be often depict come to life commonly in horror movie skeleton can also be depict in movie wear chainmail helmet and shield commonly hold an axe or sword in these type of movie they be commonly get attack kill or fight with character s skeleton can also be find in a more welcoming and friendly way in movie such a playing a a decoration a halloween paint etc another way skeleton can be show in movie be debatably more

in differential geometry a subject of mathematics a manifold be a smooth manifold equip with a closed nondegenerate differential call the symplectic form the study of symplectic manifold be call symplectic geometry or symplectic topology symplectic manifold arise naturally in abstract formulation of classical mechanic and analytical mechanic a the cotangent bundle of manifold for example in the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanic which provide one of the major motivation for the field the set of all possible configuration of a system be model a a manifold and this manifold cotangent bundle describe the phase space of the system symplectic manifold arise from classical mechanic in particular they be a generalization of the phase space of a closed system in the same way the hamilton equation allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equation the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describe the flow of the system from the differential dh of a hamiltonian function h so we require a linear map or equivalently an element of let ω denote a section of the requirement that ω be ensure that for every differential dh there be a unique corresponding vector field vh such that since one desire the hamiltonian to be constant along flow line one should have which implies that ω be alternate and hence a finally one make the requirement that ω should not change under flow line that the lie derivative of ω along vh vanishes apply cartan formula this amount to here be the interior product so that on repeat this argument for different smooth function such that the corresponding span the tangent space at each point the argument be apply at we see that the requirement for the vanish lie derivative along flow of correspond to arbitrary smooth be equivalent to the requirement that ω should be close a form on a smooth manifold be a closed differential here mean that for every point the pairing on the tangent space define by be that be to say if there exist an such that for all then since in odd dimension matrix be always singular the requirement that be nondegenerate implies that have an even dimension the closed condition mean that the exterior derivative of vanishes a manifold be a pair where be a smooth manifold and be a symplectic form assign a symplectic form to be refer to a give a structure there be a standard linear model namely a symplectic vector space let be a basis for we define our symplectic form ω on this basis a follow in this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple quadratic form if in denote the n n identity matrix then the matrix ω of this quadratic form be give by the block matrix there be several natural geometric notion of submanifold of a symplectic manifold submanifolds of potentially of any even dimension be submanifolds such that be a symplectic form on submanifolds be submanifolds where the symplectic form restrict to zero each tangent space be an isotropic subspace of the ambient manifold tangent space similarly if each tangent subspace to a submanifold be the dual of an isotropic subspace the submanifold be call submanifolds of a symplectic manifold be submanifolds where the restriction of the symplectic form to be vanish and langrangian submanifolds be the maximal isotropic submanifolds the most important case of the isotropic submanifolds be that of submanifolds a lagrangian submanifold be by definition an isotropic submanifold of maximal dimension namely half the dimension of the ambient symplectic manifold one major example be that the graph of a symplectomorphism in the product symplectic manifold be lagrangian their intersection display rigidity property not possess by smooth manifold the arnold conjecture give the sum of the submanifold betti number a a low bound for the number of self intersection of a smooth lagrangian submanifold rather than the euler characteristic in the smooth case example let have global coordinate label then we can equip with the canonical symplectic form there be a standard lagrangian submanifold give by the form vanishes on because give any pair of tangent vector we have that to elucidate consider the case then and notice that when we expand this out both term we have a factor which be by definition the cotangent bundle of a manifold be locally model on a space similar to the first example it can be show that we can glue these affine symplectic form hence this bundle form a symplectic manifold a more example of a lagrangian submanifold be the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold for example let then we can present a where we be treat the symbol a coordinate of we can consider the subset where the coordinate and give u the zero section this example can be repeat for any manifold define by the vanish locus of smooth function and their differential another useful class of lagrangian submanifolds can be find use morse theory give a morse function and for a small enough one can construct a lagrangian submanifold give by the vanishing locus for a generic morse function we have a lagrangian intersection give by special lagrangian submanifolds in the case of kahler manifold or manifold we can make a choice on a a holomorphic where be the real part and imaginary a lagrangian submanifold be call if in addition to the above lagrangian condition the restriction to be vanish in other word the real part restrict on lead the volume form on the following example be know a special lagrangian submanifolds complex lagrangian submanifolds of hyperkahler manifold fix point of a real structure of manifold the syz conjecture have be prove for special lagrangian submanifolds but in general it be open and bring a lot of impact to the study of mirror symmetry see a fibration of a symplectic manifold m be a fibration where all of the fibre be lagrangian submanifolds since m be we can take local coordinate and by darboux theorem the symplectic form ω can be at least locally write a where d denote the exterior derivative and denote the exterior product use this we can locally think of m a be the cotangent bundle and the lagrangian fibration a the trivial fibration this be the canonical picture let l be a lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold k ω give by an immersion i be call a immersion let give a lagrangian fibration of k the composite be a map the critical value set of π i be call a caustic two lagrangian map and be call equivalent if there exist diffeomorphisms σ τ and ν such that both side of the diagram give on the right commute and τ preserve the symplectic form symbolically where τ ω denote the pull back of ω by τ a symplectic manifold endow with a metric that be compatible with the symplectic form be an almost kähler manifold in the sense that the tangent bundle have an almost complex structure but this need not be integrable symplectic manifold be special case of a poisson manifold the definition of a symplectic manifold require that the symplectic form be everywhere but if this condition be violate the manifold may still be a poisson manifold a manifold of

illustration of an activator in molecular biology a factor or factor be a protein that control the rate of transcription of genetic information from dna to messenger rna by bind to a specific dna sequence the function of tfs be to on and in order to make sure that they be express in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism group of tfs function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division cell growth and cell death throughout life cell migration and organization body plan during embryonic development and intermittently in response to signal from outside the cell such a a hormone there be up to tfs in the human genome tfs work alone or with other protein in a complex by promote a an activator or blocking a a repressor the recruitment of rna polymerase the enzyme that perform the transcription of genetic information from dna to rna to specific gene a defining feature of tfs be that they contain at least one domain dbd which attach to a specific sequence of dna adjacent to the gene that they regulate tfs be group into class base on their dbds other protein such a coactivators chromatin remodelers histone acetyltransferases histone deacetylases kinase and methylases be also essential to gene regulation but lack domain and therefore be not tfs tfs be of interest in medicine because tf mutation can cause specific disease and medication can be potentially target toward them transcription factor be essential for the regulation of gene expression and be a a consequence find in all living organisms the number of transcription factor find within an organism increase with genome size and large genome tend to have more transcription factor per gene there be approximately protein in the human genome that contain domain and of these be presume to function a transcription factor though other study indicate it to be a small number therefore approximately of gene in the genome code for transcription factor which make this family the single large family of human protein furthermore gene be often flank by several bind site for distinct transcription factor and efficient expression of each of these gene require the cooperative action of several different transcription factor see for example hepatocyte nuclear factor hence the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately human transcription factor easily account for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development transcription factor bind to either enhancer or promoter region of dna adjacent to the gene that they regulate depend on the transcription factor the transcription of the adjacent gene be either or transcription factor use a variety of mechanism for the regulation of gene expression these mechanism include stabilize or block the binding of rna polymerase to dna catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins the transcription factor can either do this directly or recruit other protein with this catalytic activity many transcription factor use one or the other of two oppose mechanism to regulate transcription histone acetyltransferase hat activity acetylate histone protein which weaken the association of dna with histone which make the dna more accessible to transcription thereby transcription histone deacetylase hdac activity deacetylates histone protein which strengthen the association of dna with histone which make the dna less accessible to transcription thereby transcription recruit coactivator or corepressor protein to the transcription factor dna complex transcription factor be one of the group of protein that read and interpret the genetic blueprint in the dna they bind to the dna and help initiate a program of increase or decrease gene transcription a such they be vital for many important cellular process below be some of the important function and biological role transcription factor be involve in basal transcription regulation in eukaryotes an important class of transcription factor call general transcription factor gtfs be necessary for transcription to occur many of these gtfs do not actually bind dna but rather be part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interact with rna polymerase directly the most common gtfs be tfiia tfiib tfiid see also tata bind protein tfiie tfiif and tfiih the preinitiation complex bind to promoter region of dna upstream to the gene that they regulate differential enhancement of transcription other transcription factor differentially regulate the expression of various gene by bind to enhancer region of dna adjacent to regulate gene these transcription factor be critical to make sure that gene be express in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount depend on the changing requirement of the organism development many transcription factor in multicellular organism be involve in development respond to stimuli these transcription factor turn the transcription of the appropriate gene which in turn allows for change in cell morphology or activity need for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation the hox transcription factor family for example be important for proper body pattern formation in organism as diverse a fruit fly to human another example be the transcription factor encode by the region y sry gene which play a major role in determine sex in human response to intercellular signal cell can communicate with each other by release molecule that produce signal cascade within another receptive cell if the signal require upregulation or downregulation of gene in the recipient cell often transcription factor will be downstream in the signal cascade estrogen signaling be an example of a fairly short signal cascade that involve the estrogen receptor transcription factor estrogen be secrete by tissue such a the ovary and placenta cross the cell membrane of the recipient cell and be bind by the estrogen receptor in the cell cytoplasm the estrogen receptor then go to the cell nucleus and bind to it site change the transcriptional regulation of the associate gene response to environment not only do transcription factor act downstream of signal cascade relate to biological stimulus but they can also be downstream of signal cascade involve in environmental stimuli example include heat shock factor hsf which upregulates gene necessary for survival at high temperature hypoxia inducible factor hif which upregulates gene necessary for cell survival in environment and sterol regulatory element bind protein srebp which help maintain proper lipid level in the cell cell cycle control many transcription factor especially some that be or tumor suppressor help regulate the cell cycle and a such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cell one example be the myc oncogene which have important role in cell growth and apoptosis pathogenesis transcription factor can also be use to alter gene expression in a host cell to promote pathogenesis a well studied example of this be the like effector tal effector secrete by xanthomonas bacteria when inject into plant these protein can enter the nucleus of the plant cell bind plant promoter sequence and activate transcription of plant gene that aid in bacterial infection tal effector contain a central repeat region in which there be a simple relationship between the identity of two critical residue in sequential repeat and sequential dna base in the tal effector target site this property likely make it easy for these protein to evolve in order to good compete with the defense mechanism of the host cell it be common in biology for important process to have multiple layer of regulation and control this be also true with transcription factor not only do transcription factor control the rate of transcription to regulate the amount of gene product rna and protein available to the cell but transcription factor themselves be regulate often by other transcription factor below be a brief synopsis of some of the way that the activity of transcription factor can be regulate synthesis transcription factor like all protein be transcribe from a gene on a chromosome into rna and then the rna be translate into protein any of these step can be regulate to affect the production and thus activity of a transcription factor an implication of this be that transcription factor can regulate themselves for example in a negative feedback loop the transcription factor act a it own repressor if the transcription factor protein bind the dna of it own gene it the production of more of itself this be one mechanism to maintain low level of a transcription factor in a cell nuclear localization in eukaryote transcription factor like most protein be transcribe in the nucleus but be then translate in the cell cytoplasm many protein that be active in the nucleus contain nuclear localization signal that direct them to the nucleus but for many transcription factor this be a key point in their regulation important class of transcription factor such a some nuclear receptor must first bind a ligand while in the cytoplasm before they can relocate to the nucleus activation transcription factor may be activate or deactivate through their domain by a number of mechanism include ligand bind not only be ligand bind able to influence where a transcription factor be locate within a cell but ligand bind can also affect whether the transcription factor be in an active state and capable of bind dna or other cofactor see for example nuclear receptor phosphorylation many transcription factor such a stat protein must be phosphorylated before they can bind dna interaction with other transcription factor or or coregulatory protein accessibility of site in eukaryote dna be organize with the help of histone into compact particle call nucleosomes where sequence of about dna base pair make turn around histone protein octamers dna within nucleosomes be inaccessible to many transcription factor some transcription factor pioneer factor be still able to bind their dna bind site on the nucleosomal dna for most other transcription factor the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motor such a chromatin remodelers alternatively the nucleosome can be partially unwrap by thermal fluctuation allow temporary access to the transcription factor bind site in many case a transcription factor need to compete for bind to it dna bind site with other transcription factor and histone or chromatin protein pair of transcription factor and other protein can play antagonistic role activator versus repressor in the regulation of the same gene availability of other factor most transcription factor do not work alone many large tf family form complex homotypic or heterotypic interaction through dimerization for gene transcription to occur a number of transcription factor must bind to dna regulatory sequence this collection of transcription factor in turn recruit intermediary protein such a cofactor that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and rna polymerase thus for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription all of these other protein must also be present and the transcription factor must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary cofactor be proteins that modulate the effect of transcription factor cofactor be interchangeable between specific gene promoter the protein complex that occupy the promoter dna and the amino acid sequence of the cofactor determine it spatial conformation for example certain steroid receptor can exchange cofactor with which be a switch between inflammation and cellular differentiation thereby steroid can affect the inflammatory response and function of certain tissue schematic diagram of the amino acid sequence amino terminus to the left and carboxylic acid terminus to the right of a prototypical transcription factor that contain a domain dbd domain ssd and activation domain ad the order of placement and the number of domain may differ in various type of transcription factor in addition the transactivation and function be frequently contain within the same domain transcription factor be modular in structure and contain the following domain domain which attach to specific sequence of dna enhancer or promoter necessary component for all vector use to drive transcription of the vector transgene promoter sequence adjacent to regulate gene dna sequence that bind transcription factor be often refer to a element domain which contain bind site for other protein such a transcription coregulators these bind site be frequently refer to a function domain or domain tad but not mix with topologically associate domain tad an optional domain a ligand binding domain which sense external signal and in response transmits these signal to the rest of the transcription complex result in or of gene expression also the dbd and domain may reside on separate protein that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression domain lactose repressor laci the dna bind domain label of the lac repressor bind it target dna sequence gold in the major groove use a motif effector molecule bind green occurs in the core domain label a signal sense domain this trigger an allosteric response mediate by the linker region label the portion domain of the transcription factor that bind dna be call it domain below be a partial list of some of the major family of factor family interpro pfam scop basic zipper bzip effector domain of the bipartite response regulator box homeodomain protein which be encode by homeobox gene be transcription factor homeodomain protein play critical role in the regulation of development lambda serum response factor pair box wing helix zinc finger zinc finger nuclear receptor zinc finger response elements the dna sequence that a transcription factor bind to be call a transcription site or response element transcription factor interact with their binding site use a combination of electrostatic of which hydrogen bond be a special case and van der waals force due to the nature of these chemical interaction most transcription factor bind dna in a sequence specific manner however not all base in the transcription site may actually interact with the transcription factor in addition some of these interaction may be weak than others thus transcription factor do not bind just one sequence but be capable of bind a subset of closely related sequence each with a different strength of interaction for example although the consensus bind site for the protein tbp be tataaaa the tbp transcription factor can also bind similar sequence such a tatatat or tatataa because transcription factor can bind a set of related sequence and these sequence tend to be short potential transcription factor bind site can occur by chance if the dna sequence be long enough it be unlikely however that a transcription factor will bind all compatible sequence in the genome of the cell other constraint such a dna accessibility in the cell or availability of cofactor may also help dictate where a transcription factor will actually bind thus give the genome sequence it be still difficult to predict where a transcription factor will actually bind in a living cell additional recognition specificity however may be obtain through the use of more than one domain for example tandem dbds in the same transcription factor or through dimerization of two transcription factor that bind to two or more adjacent sequence of dna transcription factor be of clinical significance for at least two reason mutation can be associate with specific disease and they can be target of medication due to their important role in development intercellular signaling and cell cycle some human disease have be associate with mutation in transcription factor many transcription factor be either tumor suppressor or oncogene and thus mutation or aberrant regulation of them be associate with

osteoarthritis mutation or reduced activity of potential drug target approximately of currently prescribe drug directly target the nuclear receptor class of transcription factor examples include tamoxifen and bicalutamide for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer respectively and various type of and anabolic steroid in addition transcription factor be often indirectly modulate by drug through signal cascade it might be possible to directly target other transcription factor such a with drug transcription factor outside the nuclear receptor family be think to be more difficult to target with small molecule therapeutic since it be not clear that they be drugable but progress have be make on and the notch pathway gene duplication have play a crucial role in the evolution of specie this apply particularly to transcription factor once they occur a duplicate accumulate mutation encode for one copy can take place without negatively affect the regulation of downstream target however change of the dna bind specificity of the leafy transcription factor which occur in most land plant have recently be elucidate in that respect a transcription factor can undergo a change of specificity through a promiscuous intermediate without lose function similar mechanism have be propose in the context of all alternative phylogenetic hypothesis and the role of transcription factor in the evolution of all specie there be different technology available to analyze transcription factor on the genomic level and database research be commonly use the protein version of the transcription factor be detectable by use specific antibody the sample be detect on a western blot by use electrophoretic mobility shift assay emsa the activation profile of transcription factor can be detect a multiplex approach for activation profiling be a tf chip system where several different transcription factor can be detect in parallel the most commonly use method for identify transcription factor bind site be chromatin immunoprecipitation chip this technique rely on chemical fixation of chromatin with formaldehyde follow by of dna and the transcription factor of interest use an antibody that specifically target that protein the dna sequence can then be identify by microarray or sequencing to determine transcription factor bind site if no antibody be available for the protein of interest damid may be a convenient alternative a describe in more detail below transcription factor may be classify by their mechanism of action regulatory function or sequence homology and hence structural

a powder diffractometer in motion crystallography be the experimental science determine the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal in which the crystalline structure cause a beam of incident to diffract into many specific direction by measure the angle and intensity of these diffract beam a crystallographer can produce a picture of the density of electron within the crystal from this electron density the mean position of the atom in the crystal can be determine as well a their chemical bond their crystallographic disorder and various other information since many material can form a salts metal mineral semiconductor as well a various inorganic organic and biological crystallography have be fundamental in the development of many scientific field in it first decade of use this method determine the size of atom the length and type of chemical bond and the difference among various material especially mineral and alloy the method also reveal the structure and function of many biological molecule include vitamin drug protein and nucleic acid such a dna crystallography be still the primary method for characterize the atomic structure of new material and in discern material that appear similar by other experiment crystal structure can also account for unusual electronic or elastic property of a material shed light on chemical interaction and process or serve a the basis for design pharmaceutical against disease in a diffraction measurement a crystal be mount on a goniometer the goniometer be use to position the crystal at select orientation the crystal be illuminate with a finely focused monochromatic beam of produce a diffraction pattern of regularly space spot know a reflection the image take at different orientation be convert into a model of the density of electron within the crystal use the mathematical method of fourier transforms combine with chemical data know for the sample poor resolution fuzziness or even error may result if the crystal be too small or not uniform enough in their internal makeup crystallography be relate to several other method for determine atomic structure similar diffraction pattern can be produce by scatter electron or neutron which be likewise interpret by fourier transformation if single crystal of sufficient size can not be obtain various other method can be apply to obtain less detailed information such method include fiber diffraction powder diffraction and if the sample be not crystallize scatter sax if the material under investigation be only available in the form of nanocrystalline powder or suffers from poor crystallinity the method of electron crystallography can be apply for determine the atomic structure for all above mention diffraction method the scattering be elastic the scatter have the same wavelength a the incoming by contrast inelastic scattering method be useful in study excitation of the sample such a plasmons and orbital excitation magnons and phonons rather than the distribution of it atom scientific history of crystal and kepler work strena seu de nive sexangula crystal though long admire for their regularity and symmetry be not investigate scientifically until the century johannes kepler hypothesize in his work strena seu de nive sexangula a new year gift of hexagonal snow that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystal be due to a regular packing of spherical water particle tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen bond about each water molecule the water molecule be arrange similarly to the silicon atom in the tridymite polymorph of the resulting crystal structure have hexagonal symmetry when view along a principal axis the danish scientist nicolas steno pioneered experimental investigation of crystal symmetry steno show that the angle between the face be the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal and rené just haüy discover that every face of a crystal can be describe by simple stack pattern of block of the same shape and size hence william hallow miller in be able to give each face a unique label of three small integer the miller index which remain in use today for identify crystal face haüy study lead to the correct idea that crystal be a regular array a bravais lattice of atom and molecules a single unit cell be repeat indefinitely along three principal direction that be not necessarily perpendicular in the century a complete catalog of the possible symmetry of a crystal be work out by johan hessel auguste bravais evgraf fedorov arthur schönflies and belatedly william barlow from the available data and physical reasoning barlow propose several crystal structure in the that be validate later by crystallography however the available data be too scarce in the to accept his model a conclusive crystallography show the arrangement of water molecule in ice reveal the hydrogen bond that hold the solid together few other method can determine the structure of matter with such precision resolution wilhelm röntgen discover in just a the study of crystal symmetry be be complete physicist be uncertain of the nature of but soon suspect that they be wave of electromagnetic radiation a form of light the maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation be well accept among scientist and experiment by charles glover barkla show that exhibit phenomenon associate with electromagnetic wave include transverse polarization and spectral line akin to those observe in the visible wavelengths experiment in the laboratory of arnold sommerfeld suggest that have a wavelength of about angstrom be not only wave but be also photon and have particle property albert einstein introduce the photon concept in but it be not broadly accept until when arthur compton confirm it by the scattering of from electron the property of such a their ionization of gas have prompt william henry bragg to argue in that be not electromagnetic radiation bragg view prove unpopular and the observation of diffraction by max von laue in confirm for most scientist that be a form of electromagnetic radiation diffraction the incoming beam come from upper leave cause each scatterer to a small portion of it intensity a a spherical wave if scatterers be arrange symmetrically with a separation d these spherical wave will be in sync add constructively only in direction where their difference d sin θ equal an integer multiple of the wavelength λ in that case part of the incoming beam be deflect by an angle produce a reflection spot in the diffraction pattern crystal be regular array of atom and can be consider wave of electromagnetic radiation atom scatter wave primarily through the atoms electron just a an ocean wave strike a lighthouse produce secondary circular wave emanate from the lighthouse so an strike an electron produce secondary spherical wave emanate from the electron this phenomenon be know a elastic scattering and the electron or lighthouse be know a the scatterer a regular array of scatterers produce a regular array of spherical wave although these wave cancel one another out in most direction through destructive interference they add constructively in a few specific direction determine by bragg law here d be the space between diffract plane be the incident angle n be any integer and λ be the wavelength of the beam these specific direction appear a spot on the diffraction pattern call reflection thus diffraction result from an electromagnetic wave the impinging on a regular array of scatterers the repeat arrangement of atom within the crystal be use to produce the diffraction pattern because their wavelength λ be typically the same order of magnitude angstrom a the space d between plane in the crystal in principle any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produce diffraction a predict first by francesco maria grimaldi in to produce significant diffraction the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinge wave should be similar in size for illustration the diffraction of sunlight through a bird feather be first report by james gregory in the late century the first artificial diffraction grating for visible light be construct by david rittenhouse in and joseph von fraunhofer in however visible light have too long a wavelength typically angstroms to observe diffraction from crystal prior to the first diffraction experiment the spacing between lattice plane in a crystal be not know with certainty the idea that crystal could be use a a diffraction grate for arose in in a conversation between paul peter ewald and max von laue in the english garden in munich ewald have propose a resonator model of crystal for his thesis but this model could not be validate use visible light since the wavelength be much large than the spacing between the resonator von laue realize that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength be need to observe such small spacing and suggest that might have a wavelength comparable to the spacing in crystal von laue work with two technician walter friedrich and his assistant paul knipping to shine a beam of through a copper sulfate crystal and record it diffraction on a photographic plate after be develop the plate show a large number of spot arrange in a pattern of intersect circle around the spot produce by the central beam von laue develop a law that connect the scattering angle and the size and orientation of the spacing in the crystal for which he be award the nobel prize in physic in as describe in the mathematical derivation below the scattering be determine by the density of electron within the crystal since the energy of an be much great than that of a valence electron the scattering may be model a thomson scatter the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron this model be generally adopt to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation the intensity of thomson scatter for one particle with mass m and elementary charge q be hence the atomic nucleus which be much heavy than an electron contribute negligibly to the scatter from to although diamond top left and graphite top right be identical in chemical both pure crystallography reveal the arrangement of their atom bottom account for their different property in diamond the carbon atom be arrange tetrahedrally and hold together by single covalent bond make it strong in all direction by contrast graphite be compose of stacked sheet within the sheet the bonding be covalent and have hexagonal symmetry but there be no covalent bond between the sheet make graphite easy to cleave into flake after von laue pioneer research the field develop rapidly most notably by physicist william lawrence bragg and his father william henry bragg in the young bragg develop bragg law which connect the observed scattering with reflection from evenly space plane within the crystal the bragg father and son share the nobel prize in physic for their work in crystallography the early structure be generally simple and mark by symmetry however a computational and experimental method improve over the next decade it become feasible to deduce reliable atomic position for more complicated and arrangement of atom in the the potential of crystallography for determine the structure of molecule and only know vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic realize immediately the early structure be simple inorganic crystal and mineral but even these reveal fundamental law of physic and chemistry the first structure to be solve determine in be that of table salt the distribution of electron in the structure show that crystal be not necessarily compose of covalently bond molecule and prove the existence of ionic compound the structure of diamond be solve in the same year prove the tetrahedral arrangement of it chemical bond and show that the length of single bond be angstroms other early structure include copper calcium fluoride also know a fluorite calcite and pyrite in spinel in the rutile and anatase form of titanium dioxide in pyrochroite mn oh and by extension brucite mg oh in also in sodium nitrate and caesium dichloroiodide be determine by ralph walter graystone wyckoff and the wurtzite hexagonal zn structure become know in the structure of graphite be solve in by the related method of powder diffraction which be develop by peter debye and paul scherrer and independently by albert hull in the structure of graphite be determine from diffraction in by two group independently hull also use the powder method to determine the structure of various metal such a iron and magnesium and aesthetic in the festival pattern group at the festival of britain host a collaborative group of textile manufacturer and experienced crystallographer to design lace and print base on the crystallography of insulin china clay and hemoglobin one of the lead scientist of the project be helen megaw the assistant director of research at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge at the time megaw be credit a one of the central figure who take inspiration from crystal diagram and saw their potential in design in the wellcome collection in london curated an exhibition on the festival pattern group call from atom to pattern crystallography have lead to a good understanding of chemical bond and interaction the initial study reveal the typical radius of atom and confirm many theoretical model of chemical bonding such a the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure the octahedral bonding of metal observe in ammonium hexachloroplatinate iv and the resonance observe in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecule kathleen lonsdale structure of hexamethylbenzene establish the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and show a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic bond and aromatic bond this finding lead to the idea of resonance between chemical bond which have profound consequence for the development of chemistry her conclusion be anticipate by william henry bragg who publish model of naphthalene and anthracene in base on other molecule an early form of molecular replacement also in the victor moritz goldschmidt and later linus pauling developed rule for eliminate chemically unlikely structure and for determine the relative size of atom these rule lead to the structure of brookite and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile brookite and anatase form of titanium dioxide the distance between two bond atom be a sensitive measure of the bond strength and it bond order thus crystallographic study have lead to the discovery of even more exotic type of bonding in inorganic chemistry such a double bond quadruple bond and bond strictly speak an inelastic compton scatter also provide evidence for the partly covalent character of hydrogen bond in the field of organometallic chemistry the structure of ferrocene initiate scientific study of sandwich compound while that of zeise salt stimulate research into back bonding and complex finally crystallography have a pioneering role in the development of supramolecular chemistry particularly in clarify the structure of the crown ether and the principle of chemistry diffraction be a very powerful tool in catalyst development measurement be carry out routinely for check the crystal structure of material or to unravel new structure experiment give comprehensive understanding about the structural stability of catalyst under reaction condition in material science many complicate inorganic and organometallic system have be analyze use method such a fullerene metalloporphyrins and other complicate compound diffraction be also use in the pharmaceutical industry due to recent problem with polymorph the major factor affect the quality of structure be the crystal size and regularity recrystallization be a commonly use technique to improve these factor in crystal the cambridge structural database contain over structure a of june over of these structure be determine by diffraction and first diffraction view of martian soil chemin analysis reveals feldspar pyroxene olivine and more curiosity rover at rocknest october since the diffraction have be the principal method for determine the arrangement of atom in mineral and metal the application of crystallography to mineralogy begin with the structure of garnet which be determine in by menzer a systematic crystallographic study of the silicate be undertake in the this study show that a the ratio be alter the silicate crystal exhibit significant change in their atomic arrangement machatschki extend these insight to mineral in which aluminium substitute for the silicon atom of the silicate the first application of crystallography to metallurgy likewise occur in the most notably linus pauling structure of the alloy lead to his theory of the stability and structure of complex ionic crystal on october the curiosity rover on the planet mar at rocknest perform the first diffraction analysis of martian soil the result from the rover chemin analyzer reveal the presence of several mineral include feldspar pyroxene and olivine and suggest that the martian soil in the sample be similar to the weather basaltic soil of hawaiian volcano organic and small biological the structure of penicillin solve by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin in the green red yellow and blue sphere represent atom of carbon oxygen sulfur and nitrogen respectively the white sphere represent hydrogen which be determine mathematically rather than by the analysis the first structure of an organic compound hexamethylenetetramine be solve in this be follow by several study of fatty acid which be an important component of biological membrane in the the structure of much large molecule with complexity begin to be solve a significant advance be the structure of phthalocyanine a large planar molecule that be closely relate to porphyrin molecule important in biology such a heme corrin and chlorophyll crystallography of biological molecule take off with dorothy crowfoot hodgkin who solve the structure of cholesterol penicillin and vitamin for which she be award the nobel prize in chemistry in in she succeed in solve the structure of insulin on which she work for over thirty year macromolecular ribbon diagram of the structure of myoglobin showing color alpha helix such protein be long linear molecule with thousand of atom yet the relative position of each atom have be determine with resolution by crystallography since it be difficult to visualize all the atom at once the ribbon show the rough path of the protein polymer from it blue to it red crystal structure of protein which be irregular and hundred of time large than cholesterol begin to be solve in the late beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by sir john cowdery kendrew for which he share the nobel prize in chemistry with max perutz in since that success over crystal structure of protein nucleic acid and other biological molecule have be determine the near compete method in number of structure analyze be nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy which have resolve less than one tenth a many crystallography can solve structure of arbitrarily large molecule whereas nmr be restrict to relatively small one less than kda crystallography be use routinely to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with it protein target and what change might improve it however intrinsic membrane protein remain challenge to crystallize because they require detergent or other denaturant to solubilize them in isolation and such detergent often interfere with crystallization membrane protein be a large component of the genome and include many protein of great physiological importance such a ion channel and receptor helium cryogenics be use to prevent radiation damage in protein crystal on the other end of the size scale even relatively small molecule may pose challenge for the resolve power of crystallography the structure assign in to the antibiotic isolate from a marine organism diazonamide a molar mass prove to be incorrect by the classical proof of structure a synthetic sample be not identical to the natural product the mistake be attribute to the inability of crystallography to distinguish between the correct and the interchanged group in the incorrect structure with advance in instrumentation however similar group can be distinguish use modern diffractometers despite be an invaluable tool in structural biology protein crystallography carry some inherent problem in it methodology that hinder data interpretation the crystal lattice which be form during the crystallization process contain numerous unit of the purified protein which be densely and symmetrically pack in the crystal when look for a previously unknown protein figure out it shape and boundary within the crystal lattice can be challenging protein be usually compose of small subunit and the task of distinguish between the subunit and identify the actual protein can be challenge even for the experienced crystallographer the interface that occur during crystallization be know a contact or simply crystal contact and can not be distinguish by crystallographic mean when a new protein structure be solve by crystallography and deposit in the protein data bank it author be request to specify the which would constitute the functional protein however error miss data and inaccurate annotation during the submission of the data give rise to obscure structure and compromise the reliability of the database the error rate in the case of faulty annotation alone have be report to be upwards of or approximately arguably a size consider the number of deposited structure this classification be typically tackle by computational approach and have become a recognized subject in structural bioinformatics inelastic crystallography be a form of elastic scatter the outgoing have the same energy and thus same wavelength a the incoming only with alter direction by contrast inelastic scattering occur when energy be transfer from the incoming to the crystal by excite an electron to a high energy level such inelastic scattering reduce the energy or increase the wavelength of the outgo beam inelastic scattering be useful for probe such excitation of matter but not in determine the distribution of scatterers within the matter which be the goal of crystallography range in wavelength from to nanometer a typical wavelength use for crystallography be å nm which be on the scale of covalent chemical bond and the radius of a single atom photon such a ultraviolet radiation would not have sufficient resolution to determine the atomic position at the other extreme photon such a gamma ray be difficult to produce in large number difficult to focus and interact too strongly with matter produce pair therefore be the sweetspot for wavelength when determine structure from the scattering of electromagnetic radiation other form of elastic scatter besides diffraction include powder diffraction scatter sax and several type of fiber diffraction which be use by rosalind franklin in determine the structure of dna in general diffraction offer more structural information than these other technique however it require a sufficiently large and regular crystal which be not always available these scatter method generally use monochromatic which be restrict to a single wavelength with minor deviation a broad spectrum of that be a blend of with different wavelength can also be use to carry out diffraction a technique know a the laue method this be the method use in the original discovery of diffraction laue scatter provide much structural information with only a short exposure to the beam and be therefore use in structural study of very rapid event time resolve crystallography however it be not a a monochromatic scattering for determine the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore work well with crystal with relatively simple atomic arrangement the laue back reflection mode record scatter backwards from a broad spectrum source this be useful if the sample be too thick for to transmit through it the diffract plane in the crystal be determine by know that the normal to the diffract plane bisect the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam a greninger chart can be use to interpret the back reflection laue photograph and neutron other particle such a electron and neutron may be use to produce a diffraction pattern although electron neutron and scatter be base on different physical process the result diffraction pattern be analyze use the same coherent diffraction image technique a derive below the electron density within the crystal and the diffraction pattern be relate by a simple mathematical method the fourier transform which allow the density to be calculate relatively easily from the pattern however this work only if the scattering be weak if the scattered beam be much less intense than the incoming beam weakly scatter beam pass through the remainder of the crystal without undergo a second scatter event such wave be call secondary scattering and hinder the analysis any sufficiently thick crystal will produce secondary scattering but since interact relatively weakly with the electron this be generally not a significant concern by contrast electron beam may produce strong secondary scattering even for relatively thin crystal nm since this thickness correspond to the diameter of many virus a promising direction be the electron diffraction of isolated macromolecular assembly such a viral capsid and molecular machine which may be carry out with a microscope moreover the strong interaction of electron with matter about time strong than for allows determination of the atomic structure of extremely small volume the field of application for electron crystallography range from bio molecule like membrane protein over organic thin film to the complex structure of nanocrystalline intermetallic compound and zeolites neutron diffraction be an excellent method for structure determination although it have be difficult to obtain intense monochromatic beam of neutron in sufficient quantity traditionally nuclear reactor have be use although source produce neutron by spallation be become increasingly available be uncharged neutron scatter much more readily from the atomic nucleus rather than from the electron therefore neutron scattering be very useful for observe the position of light atom with few electron especially hydrogen which be essentially invisible in the diffraction neutron scattering also have the remarkable property that the solvent can be make invisible by adjust the ratio of normal water and heavy water of workflow for solve the structure of a molecule by crystallography the old and most precise method of crystallography be diffraction in which a beam of strike a single crystal produce scattered beam when they land on a piece of film or other detector these beam make a diffraction pattern of spot the strength and angle of these beam be record a the crystal be gradually rotate each spot be call a reflection since it correspond to the reflection of the from one set of evenly space plane within the crystal for single crystal of sufficient purity and regularity diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond length and angle to within a few thousandth of an angstrom and to within a few tenth of a degree respectively the atom in a crystal be not static but oscillate about their mean position usually by less than a few tenth of an angstrom crystallography allow measure the size of these oscillation the technique of crystallography have three basic step the often most be to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study the crystal should be sufficiently large typically large than mm in all dimension pure in composition and regular in structure with no significant internal imperfection such a crack or twin in the second step the crystal be place in an intense beam of usually of a single wavelength monochromatic produce the regular pattern of reflection the angle and intensity of diffract be measure with each compound have a unique diffraction pattern a the crystal be gradually rotate previous reflection disappear and new one appear the intensity of every spot be record at every orientation of the crystal multiple data set may have to be collect with each set cover slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically contain ten of thousand of reflection in the third step these data be combine computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atom within the crystal the final refined model of the atomic call a crystal structure usually store in a public database a the crystal repeating unit it unit cell become large and more complex the picture provide by crystallography becomes less more fuzzy for a give number of observed reflection two limit case of which include continuous inorganic solid and macromolecular often discern crystallography typically involve crystal with few than atom in their asymmetric unit such crystal structure be usually so well resolve that the atom can be discern a isolated blob of electron density by contrast macromolecular crystallography often involve ten of thousand of atom in the unit cell such crystal structure be generally less more smear out the atom and chemical bond appear a tube of electron density rather than as isolated atom in general small molecule be also easy to crystallize than macromolecule however crystallography have prove possible even for virus and protein with hundred of thousand of atom through improve crystallographic imaging and technology though normally crystallography can only be perform if the sample be in crystal form new research have be do into sample form of sample a protein crystal see under a microscope crystal use in crystallography may be small than a millimeter across although crystallography can be use to characterize the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal crystallography generally require a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atom pure regular crystal can sometimes be obtain from natural or synthetic material such a sample of metal mineral or other macroscopic material the regularity of such crystal can sometimes be improve with macromolecular crystal annealing and other method however in many case obtain a crystal be the chief barrier to solve it structure and macromolecular crystallography differ in the range of possible technique use to produce crystal small molecule generally have few degree of conformational freedom and may be crystallize by a wide range of method such a chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization by contrast macromolecule generally have many degree of freedom and their crystallization must be carry out so a to maintain a stable structure for example protein and large rna molecule can not be crystallize if their tertiary structure have be unfold therefore the range of crystallization condition be restrict to solution condition in which such molecule remain folded three method of prepare crystal a hang drop b sit drop c microdialysis protein crystal be almost always grow in solution the most common approach be to lower the solubility of it component molecule very gradually if this be do too quickly the molecule will precipitate from solution form a useless dust or amorphous gel on the bottom of the container crystal growth in solution be characterize by two step nucleation of a microscopic crystallite possibly have only molecule follow by growth of that crystallite ideally to a crystal the solution condition that favor the first step nucleation be not always the same condition that favor the second step subsequent growth the crystallographer goal be to identify solution condition that favor the development of a single large crystal since large crystal offer improved resolution of the molecule consequently the solution condition should disfavor the first step nucleation but favor the second growth so that only one large crystal form per droplet if nucleation be favor too much a shower of small crystallite will form in the droplet rather than one large crystal if favor too little no crystal will form whatsoever other approach involve crystallize protein under oil where aqueous protein solution be dispense under liquid oil and water evaporates through the layer of oil different oil have different evaporation permeability therefore yield change in concentration rate from different mixture it be extremely difficult to predict good condition for nucleation or growth of crystal in practice favorable condition be identify by screen a very large batch of the molecule be prepared and a wide variety of crystallization solution be test hundred even thousand of solution condition be generally try before find the successful one the various condition can use one or more physical mechanism to lower the solubility of the molecule for example some may change the ph some contain salt of the hofmeister series or chemical that lower the dielectric constant of the solution and still others contain large polymer such a polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effect it be also common to try several temperature for encourage crystallization or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution become supersaturated these method require large amount of the target molecule a they use high concentration of the molecule s to be crystallize due to the difficulty in obtain such large quantity milligram of protein robot have be develop that be capable of accurately dispense crystallization trial drop that be in the order of nanoliters in volume this mean that less protein be use per experiment when compare to crystallization trial set up by hand in the order of microliter several factor be know to inhibit or mar crystallization the grow crystal be generally hold at a constant temperature and protect from shock or vibration that might disturb their crystallization impurity in the molecule or in the crystallization solution be often inimical to crystallization conformational flexibility in the molecule also tend to make crystallization less likely due to entropy molecule that tend to into regular helix be often unwilling to assemble into crystal crystal can be mar by twin which can occur when a unit cell can pack equally favorably in multiple orientation although recent advance in computational method may allow solve the structure of some twin crystal have fail to crystallize a target molecule a crystallographer may try again with a slightly modify version of the molecule even small change in molecular property can lead to large difference in crystallization behavior the animation show the five motion possible with a kappa goniometer the rotation about each of the four angle φ κ ω and leave the crystal within the beam but change the crystal orientation the detector red box can be slid closer or far away from the crystal allow high resolution data to be take if close or well discernment of the bragg peak if further away the crystal be mount for measurement so that it may be hold in the beam and rotate there be several method of mount in the past crystal be load into glass capillary with the crystallization solution the mother liquor nowadays crystal of small molecule be typically attach with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop which be make of nylon or plastic and attach to a solid rod protein crystal be scoop up by a loop then with liquid nitrogen this freezing reduce the radiation damage of the as well a the noise in the bragg peak due to thermal motion the effect however untreated protein crystal often crack if therefore they be generally in a cryoprotectant solution before freeze unfortunately this may itself cause the crystal to crack ruin it for crystallography generally successful be identify by trial and error the capillary or loop be mount on a goniometer which allow it to be position accurately within the beam and rotate since both the crystal and the beam be often very small the crystal must be center within the beam to within micrometer accuracy which be aid by a camera focus on the crystal the most common type of goniometer be the kappa goniometer which offer three angle of rotation the ω angle which rotate about an axis perpendicular to the beam the κ angle about an axis at to the ω axis and finally the φ angle about the axis when the κ angle be zero the ω and φ ax be align the κ rotation allow for convenient mounting of the crystal since the arm in which the crystal be mount may be swing out towards the crystallographer the oscillation carry out during data collection mention below involve the ω axis only an old type of goniometer be the goniometer and it relative such a the goniometer small scale crystallography can be do with a local tube source typically couple with an image plate detector these have the advantage of be relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain and allow for quick screening and collection of sample however the wavelength of the light produce be limit by the availability of different anode material furthermore the intensity be limit by the power apply and cool capacity available to avoid melt the anode in such system electron be boil off of a cathode and accelerate through a strong electric potential of kv have reach a high speed the electron collide with a metal plate emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral line correspond to the excitation of electron of the metal the most common metal use be copper which can be keep cool easily due to it high thermal conductivity and which produce strong kα and kβ line the kβ line be sometimes suppress with a thin µm nickel foil the simple and cheap variety of sealed tube have a stationary anode the crookes tube and run with kw of electron beam power the more expensive variety have a type source that run with kw of power be generally filter by use of filter to a single wavelength make monochromatic and collimate to a single direction before they be allow to strike the crystal the filtering not only simplify the data analysis but also remove radiation that degrade the crystal without contribute useful information collimation be do either with a collimator basically a long tube or with a clever arrangement of gently curve mirror mirror system be prefer for small crystal under mm or with large unit cell over å rotate anode be use by joanna joka maria vandenberg in the first experiment that demonstrate the power of x ray for quick in real time production screening of large ingaasp thin film wafer for quality control of quantum well laser synchrotron radiation source be some of the bright light source on earth and be some of the most powerful tool available to crystallographer beam generate in large machine call synchrotron which accelerate electrically charge particle often electron to nearly the speed of light and confine them in a roughly circular loop use magnetic field synchrotron be generally national facility each with several dedicate beamlines where data be collect without interruption synchrotron be originally design for use by physicist study subatomic particle and cosmic phenomenon the large component of each synchrotron be it electron storage ring this ring be actually not a perfect circle but a polygon at each corner of the polygon or sector precisely aligned magnet bend the electron stream a the electron path be bent they emit burst of energy in the form of use synchrotron radiation frequently have specific requirement for crystallography the intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to sample particularly macromolecular crystal cryo crystallography protect the sample from radiation damage by freeze the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperature k however synchrotron radiation frequently have the advantage of wavelength allow for anomalous scatter experiment which maximize anomalous signal this be critical in experiment such a sad and mad laser have be develop for use in crystallography these be the bright source currently available with the come in femtosecond burst the intensity of the source be such that atomic resolution diffraction pattern can be resolve for crystal otherwise too small for collection however the intense light source also destroy the sample require multiple crystal to be shoot a each crystal be randomly orient in the beam hundred of thousand of individual diffraction image must be collect in order to get a complete data set this method serial femtosecond crystallography have be use in solve the structure of a number of protein crystal structure sometimes note difference with equivalent structure collect from synchrotron source the an diffraction pattern of a crystallized enzyme the pattern of spot reflection and the relative strength of each spot intensity can be use to determine the structure of the enzyme when a crystal be mount and expose to an intense beam of it scatter the into a pattern of spot or reflection that can be observe on a screen behind the crystal a similar pattern may be see by shin a laser pointer at a compact disc the relative intensity of these spot provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecule within the crystal in atomic detail the intensity of these reflection may be record with photographic film an area detector such a a pixel detector or with a device ccd image sensor the peak at small angle correspond to data whereas those at high angle represent data thus an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determine from the first few image some measure of diffraction quality can be determine at this point such a the mosaicity of the crystal and it overall disorder a observe in the peak width some pathology of the crystal that would render it unfit for solve the structure can also be diagnose quickly at this point one image of spot be insufficient to reconstruct the whole crystal it represent only a small slice of the full fourier transform to collect all the necessary information the crystal must be rotate through with an image record at every step actually slightly more than be require to cover reciprocal space due to the curvature of the ewald sphere however if the crystal have a high symmetry a small angular range such a or may be record the rotation axis should be change at least once to avoid develop a blind spot in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis it be customary to rock the crystal slightly by to catch a broad region of reciprocal space multiple data set may be necessary for certain phasing method for example mad phase require that the scattering be record at least three and usually four for redundancy wavelength of the incoming radiation a single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set owe to radiation damage in such case data set on multiple crystal must be take symmetry unit cell and image the recorded series of diffraction pattern each correspond to a different crystal orientation be convert into a model of the electron density the conversion use the mathematical technique of fourier transforms which be explain below each spot correspond to a different type of variation in the electron density the crystallographer must determine which variation corresponds to which spot index the relative strength of the spot in different image merge and scale and how the variation should be combine to yield the total electron density phase data processing begin with index the reflection this mean identify the dimension of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space a byproduct of indexing be to determine the symmetry of the crystal it space group some space group can be eliminate from the beginning for example reflection symmetry can not be observe in chiral molecule thus only space group of possible be allow for protein molecule which be almost always chiral indexing be generally accomplish use an autoindexing routine have assign symmetry the data be then integrate this convert the hundred of image contain the thousand of reflection into a single file consist of at the very least record of the miller index of each reflection and an intensity for each reflection at this state the file often also include error estimate and measure of partiality what part of a give reflection be record on that image a full data set may consist of hundred of separate image take at different orientation of the crystal the first step be to merge and scale these various image that be to identify which peak appear in two or more image merge and to scale the relative image so that they have a consistent intensity scale optimize the intensity scale be critical because the relative intensity of the peak be the key information from which the structure be determine the repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline material cause the diffractometer to record many reflection multiple time this allow calculate the a reliability index base upon how similar be the measured intensity of reflection thus assess the quality of the data the data collect from a diffraction experiment be a reciprocal space representation of the crystal lattice the position of each diffraction be govern by the size and shape of the unit cell and the inherent symmetry within the crystal the intensity of each diffraction be record and this intensity be proportional to the square of the structure factor amplitude the structure factor be a complex number contain information relating to both the amplitude and phase of a wave in order to obtain an interpretable electron density map both amplitude and phase must be know an electron density map allow a crystallographer to build a starting model of the molecule the phase can not be directly record during a diffraction experiment this be know a the phase problem initial phase estimate can be obtain in a variety of way ab initio phasing or method this be usually the method of choice for small molecule free which be calculate from a subset of reflection that be not include in the structure refinement both r factor depend on the resolution of the data a a rule of thumb r free should be approximately the resolution in angstrom divide by thus a with å resolution should yield a final r free chemical bond feature such a stereochemistry hydrogen bonding and distribution of bond length and angle be complementary measure of the model quality phase bias be a serious problem in such iterative model building map be a common technique use to check for this it may not be possible to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit in many case crystallographic disorder smear the electron density map weakly scatter atom such a hydrogen be routinely invisible it be also possible for a single atom to appear multiple time in an electron density map if a protein sidechain have multiple efinement also refer to a profile matching that be refinement of the cell parameter base on the bragg peak position and peak profile without take into account the crystallographic structure by itself more recent tool allow the refinement of both structural and microstructural data such a the faults program include in the fullprof suite which allow the refinement of structure with planar defect stack fault twinnings intergrowths of the once the model of a molecule structure have be finalize it be often deposit in a crystallographic database such a the cambridge structural database for small molecule the inorganic crystal structure database icsd for inorganic compound or the protein data bank for protein and sometimes nucleic acid many structure obtain in private commercial venture to crystallize medicinally relevant protein be not deposit in public crystallographic databases the main goal of crystallography be to determine the density of electron f throughout the crystal where represent the position vector within the crystal to do this scattering be use to collect data about it fourier transform f which be invert mathematically to obtain the density define in real space use the formula where the integral be take over all value of the real vector represent a point in reciprocal space that be to a particular oscillation in the electron density a one move in the direction in which point the length of corresponds to divide by the wavelength of the oscillation the corresponding formula for a fourier transform will be use below where the integral be sum over all possible value of the position vector within the crystal the fourier transform f be generally a complex number and therefore have a magnitude f and a phase φ relate by the equation the intensity of the reflection observe in diffraction give u the magnitude f but not the phase φ to obtain the phase full set of reflection be collect with known alteration to the scatter either by modulate the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by add strongly scatter metal atom such a mercury combine the magnitude and phase yield the full fourier transform f which may be invert to obtain the electron density f crystal be often idealize a be perfectly periodic in that ideal case the atom be position on a perfect lattice the electron density be perfectly periodic and the fourier transform f be zero except when belongs to the reciprocal lattice the bragg peak in reality however crystal be not perfectly periodic atom vibrate about their mean position and there may be disorder of various type such a mosaicity dislocation various point defect and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecule therefore the bragg peak have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scatter a continuum of scattered that fall between the bragg peak understand by bragg an intuitive understanding of diffraction can be obtain from the bragg model of diffraction in this model a give reflection be associate with a set of evenly spaced sheet run through the crystal usually pass through the center of the atom of the crystal lattice the orientation of a particular set of sheet be identify by it three miller index h k l and let their spacing be note by d william lawrence bragg propose a model in which the incoming be scatter specularly from each plane from that assumption scatter from adjacent plane will combine constructively constructive interference when the angle θ between the plane and the result in a difference that be an integer multiple n of the wavelength a reflection be say to be index when it miller index or more correctly it reciprocal lattice vector component have be identify from the know wavelength and the scatter angle such index give the parameter the length and angle of the as well a it space group since bragg law do not interpret the relative intensity of the reflection however it be generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atom within the for that a fourier transform method must be carry out a a fourier the incoming beam have a polarization and should be represent a a vector wave however for simplicity let it be represent here a a scalar wave we also ignore the complication of the time dependence of the wave and just concentrate on the wave spatial dependence plane wave can be represent by a wave vector and so the strength of the incoming wave at time t be give by at position within the sample let there be a density of scatterers f these scatterers should produce a scattered spherical wave of amplitude proportional to the local amplitude of the incoming wave time the number of scatterers in a small volume dv about where s be the proportionality constant consider the fraction of scattered wave that leave with an outgoing of and strike the screen at since no energy be lose elastic not inelastic scatter the wavelength be the same a be the magnitude of the from the time that the photon be scatter at until it be absorb at the photon undergo a change in phase the net radiation arriving at be the sum of all the scatter wave throughout the crystal which may be write a a fourier transform where the measured intensity of the reflection will be square of this amplitude and bijvoet for every reflection correspond to a point in the reciprocal space there be another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point this opposite reflection be know a the friedel mate of the original reflection this symmetry result from the mathematical fact that the density of electron f at a position be always a real number a note above f be the inverse transform of it fourier transform f however such an inverse transform be a complex number in general to ensure that f be real the fourier transform f must be such that the friedel mat f and f be complex conjugate of one another thus f have the same magnitude a f but they have the opposite phase φ φ the equality of their magnitude ensure that the friedel mate have the same intensity f this symmetry allow one to measure the full fourier transform from only half the reciprocal space by rotate the crystal slightly more than instead of a full revolution in crystal with significant symmetry even more reflection may have the same intensity bijvoet mate in such case even less of the reciprocal space may need to be measure in favorable case of high symmetry sometimes only or even only of data be require to completely explore the reciprocal space the constraint can be derive from the definition of the inverse fourier transform since euler formula state that ei x co x i sin x the inverse fourier transform can be separate into a sum of a purely real part and a purely imaginary part the function f be real if and only if the second integral i sin be zero for all value of in turn this be true if and only if the above constraint be satisfied since i sin i sin implies that i sin each diffraction image represent only a slice a spherical slice of reciprocal space a may be see by the ewald sphere construction both and have the same length due to the elastic scattering since the wavelength have not change therefore they may be represent a two radial vector in a sphere in reciprocal space which show the value of that be sample in a give diffraction image since there be a slight spread in the incoming wavelength of the incoming beam the value f be measure only for vector locate between the two sphere correspond to those radius therefore to obtain a full set of fourier transform data it be necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry be present a full rotation be not need because of a symmetry intrinsic to the fourier transforms of real function such a the electron density but slightly more than be need to cover all of reciprocal space within a give resolution because of the curvature of the ewald sphere in practice the crystal be rock by a small amount to incorporate reflection near the boundary of the spherical ewald shell a result of fourier transforms be the autocorrelation theorem which state that the autocorrelation c of a function f have a fourier transform c that be the squared magnitude of f therefore the autocorrelation function c of the electron density also know a the patterson function can be compute directly from the reflection intensity without compute the phase in principle this could be use to determine the crystal structure directly however it be difficult to realize in practice the autocorrelation function correspond to the distribution of vector between atom in the crystal thus a crystal of n atom in it unit cell may have n n peak in it patterson function give the inevitable error in measure the intensity and the mathematical difficulty of reconstruct atomic position from the interatomic vector this technique be rarely use to solve structure except for the simple crystal of a in principle an atomic structure could be determine from apply scatter to sample even to a single molecule however crystal offer a much strong signal due to their periodicity a crystalline sample be by definition periodic a crystal be compose of many unit cell repeat indefinitely in three independent direction such periodic system have a fourier transform that be concentrate at periodically repeat point in reciprocal space know a bragg peak the bragg peak correspond to the reflection spot observe in the diffraction image since the amplitude at these reflection grows linearly with the number n of scatterers the observed intensity of these spot should grow quadratically like n in other word use a crystal concentrate the weak scattering of the individual unit cell into a much more powerful coherent reflection that can be observe above the noise this be an example of constructive interference in a liquid powder or amorphous sample molecule within that sample be in random orientation such sample have a continuous fourier spectrum that uniformly spread it amplitude thereby reduce the measured signal intensity a be observe in sax more importantly the orientational information be lose although theoretically possible it be experimentally difficult to obtain structure of complicate asymmetric molecule from such rotationally average data an intermediate case be fiber diffraction in which the subunit be arrange periodically in at least one dimension year laureate prize rationale max von laue physic for his

in mathematical analysis the measure assign an invariant volume to subset of locally compact topological group consequently define an integral for function on those group this measure be introduce by alfréd haar in though it special case for lie group have be introduce by adolf hurwitz in under the name invariant integral haar measure be use in many part of analysis number theory group theory representation theory statistic probability theory and ergodic theory let be a locally compact hausdorff topological group the generate by all open subset of be call the borel algebra an element of the borel algebra be call a borel set if be an element of and be a subset of then we define the left and right translates of a follow leave translate right translate leave and right translates map borel set into borel set a measure on the borel subset of be call if for all borel subset and all one have a measure on the borel subset of be call if for all borel subset and all one have there be up to a positive multiplicative constant a unique countably additive nontrivial measure on the borel subset of satisfy the following property the measure be for every and all borel set the measure be finite on every compact set for all compact the measure be outer regular on borel set the measure be inner regular on open set such a measure on be call a left haar measure it can be show a a consequence of the above property that for every open subset in particular if be compact then be finite and positive so we can uniquely specify a left haar measure on by add the normalization condition some author define a haar measure on baire set rather than borel set this make the regularity condition unnecessary a baire measure be automatically regular halmos rather confusingly use the term borel set for element of the generate by compact set and defines haar measure on these set the left haar measure satisfy the inner regularity condition for all borel set but may not be inner regular for all borel set for example the product of the unit circle with it usual topology and the real line with the discrete topology be a locally compact group with the product topology and haar measure on this group be not inner regular for the closed subset compact subset of this vertical segment be finite set and point have measure so the measure of any compact subset of this vertical segment be but use out regularity one can show the segment have infinite measure the existence and uniqueness up to scaling of a left haar measure be first prove in full generality by andré weil weil proof use the axiom of choice and henri cartan furnish a proof which avoid it use cartan proof also establish the existence and the uniqueness simultaneously a simplified and complete account of cartan argument be give by alfsen in the special case of invariant measure for second countable locally compact group have be show by haar in construction use compact the following method of construct haar measure be essentially the method use by haar and weil for any subset with nonempty define to be the small number of left translates of that cover so this be a integer or infinity this be not additive on compact set though it do have the property that for disjoint compact set provide that be a sufficiently small open neighborhood of the identity depend on and the idea of haar measure be to take a sort of limit of a becomes small to make it additive on all pair of disjoint compact set though it first have to be normalize so that the limit be not just infinity so fix a compact set with interior which exist a the group be locally compact and for a compact set define where the limit be take over a suitable directed set of open neighborhood of the identity eventually contain in any give neighborhood the existence of a directed set such that the limit exist follow use tychonoff theorem the function be additive on disjoint compact subset of which imply that it be a regular content from a regular content one can construct a measure by first extend to open set by inner regularity then to all set by outer regularity and then restrict it to borel set even for open set the corresponding measure need not be give by the lim sup formula above the problem be that the function give by the lim sup formula be not countably subadditive in general and in particular be infinite on any set without compact closure so be not an out measure construction use compactly support cartan introduce another way of construct haar measure a a radon measure a positive linear functional on compactly support continuous function which be similar to the construction above except that and be positive continuous function of compact support rather than subset of in this case we define to be the infimum of number such that be less than the linear combination of left translates of for some a before we define the fact that the limit exist take some effort to prove though the advantage of do this be that the proof avoid the use of the axiom of choice and also give uniqueness of haar measure a a the functional extends to a positive linear functional on compactly support continuous function and so give a haar measure note that even though the limit be linear in the individual term be not usually linear in construction use mean value of von neumann give a method of construct haar measure use mean value of function though it only work for compact group the idea be that give a function on a compact group one can find a convex combination where of it left translates that differs from a constant function by at most some small number then one show that a tends to zero the value of these constant function tend to a limit which be call the mean value or integral of the function for group that be locally compact but not compact this construction do not give haar measure a the mean value of compactly support function be zero however something like this do work for almost periodic function on the group which do have a mean value though this be not give with respect to haar measure construction on lie on an n lie group haar measure can be construct easily a the measure induce by a n this be know before haar theorem it can also be prove that there exist a unique up to multiplication by a positive constant borel measure satisfy the above regularity condition and be finite on compact set but it need not coincide with the measure the left and right haar measure be the same only for unimodular group see below it be quite simple though to find a relationship between and indeed for a borel set let u denote by the set of inverse of element of if we define then this be a right haar measure to show right invariance apply the definition because the right measure be unique it follow that be a multiple of and so for all borel set where be some positive constant modular the left translate of a right haar measure be a right haar measure more precisely if be a right haar measure then be also right invariant thus by uniqueness of the haar measure there exist a function from the group to the positive real call the modulus function or character such that for every borel set since right haar measure be up to a positive scaling factor this equation show the modular function be independent of the choice of right haar measure in the above equation the modular function be a continuous group homomorphism into the multiplicative group of positive real number a group be call if the modular function be identically or equivalently if the haar measure be both left and right invariant example of unimodular group be abelian group compact group discrete group finite group semisimple lie group and connect nilpotent lie group an example of a group be the group of affine transformation on the real line this example show that a solvable lie group need not be unimodular in this group a left haar measure be give by and a right haar measure by if the locally compact group act transitively on a homogeneous space one can ask if this space have an invariant measure or more generally a measure with the property that for some character of a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a measure be that the restriction be equal to where and be the modular function of and respectively in particular an invariant measure on exists if and only if the modular function of restrict to be the modular function of if be the group and be the subgroup of upper triangular matrix then the modular function of be nontrivial but the modular function of be trivial the quotient of these can not be extend to any character of so the quotient space which can be think of a real projective space do not have even a measure use the general theory of lebesgue integration one can then define an integral for all borel measurable function on this integral be call the integral if be a left haar measure then for any haar integrable function on this be immediate for indicator function be essentially the definition of left invariance a haar measure on the topological group which take the value on the interval be equal to the restriction of lebesgue measure to the borel subset of this can be generalize to if be the group of nonzero real number with multiplication a operation then a haar measure be give by for any borel subset of the nonzero real for example if be take to be an interval then we find now we let the multiplicative group act on this interval by a multiplication of all it element by a number result in be the interval measure this new interval

a be a dna sequence around base pair long find within gene that be involve in the regulation of pattern of anatomical development morphogenesis in animal fungi plant and numerous single cell eukaryotes homeobox gene encode protein product that be transcription factor share a characteristic protein fold structure that bind dna to regulate expression of target gene homeodomain protein regulate gene expression and cell differentiation during early embryonic development thus mutation in homeobox gene can cause developmental disorder homeosis be a term coin by william bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part of the antenna on the head of a fruit fly with leg the prefix in the word homeobox and homeodomain stem from this mutational phenotype which be frequently observe when these gene be mutate in animal the homeobox domain be first identify in a number of drosophila homeotic and segmentation protein but be now know to be in many other animal include vertebrates the existence of homeobox gene be first discover in drosophila by isolate the gene responsible for a homeotic transformation where legs grow from the head instead of the expected antenna walter gehring identify a gene call antennapedia that cause this homeotic phenotype analysis of antennapedia reveal that this gene contain a base pair sequence that encode a dna binding domain which gehring term the homeobox the existence of additional drosophila gene contain the antennapedia homeobox sequence be independently report by ernst hafen michael levine william mcginnis and walter jakob gehring of the university of basel in switzerland and matthew scott and amy weiner of indiana university in bloomington in isolation of homologous gene by edward de robertis and william mcginnis reveal that numerous gene from a variety of specie contain the homeobox subsequent phylogenetic study detail the evolutionary relationship between gene show that these gene be present in all bilaterian animal the characteristic homeodomain protein fold consists of a acid long domain compose of three alpha helixes the following show the consensus homeodomain amino acid chain helix helix helix rrrkrtaytryqllelekefhfnryltrrrrielahslnlterhikiwfqnrrmkwkken the complex helix of the homeodomain bind in the major groove of the dna and the arm bind in the minor groove in analogy with other complex helix and helix form a hth structure where the two alpha helix be connect by a short loop region the two helix of the homeodomain be antiparallel and the long helix be roughly perpendicular to the ax establish by the first two it be this third helix that interact directly with dna via a number of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction as well a indirect interaction via water molecule which occur between specific side chain and the exposed base within the major groove of the dna homeodomain protein be find in eukaryote through the hth motif they share limit sequence similarity and structural similarity to prokaryotic transcription factor such a lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of gene in prokaryote the hth motif show some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of protein cro and repressor protein homeodomain proteins one of the principal difference between hth motif in these different protein arises from the stereochemical requirement for glycine in the turn which be need to avoid steric interference of the with the main chain for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appear to be mandatory whereas for many of the homeotic and other proteins the requirement be relaxed homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to with the recognition helix align in the dna major groove and the unstructured peptide tail at the aligning in the minor groove the recognition helix and the loop be rich in arginine and lysine residue which form hydrogen bond to the dna backbone conserve hydrophobic residue in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilize the helix pack homeodomain protein show a preference for the dna sequence binding occur with significantly low affinity the specificity of a single homeodomain protein be usually not enough to recognize specific target gene promoter make cofactor bind an important mechanism for control bind sequence specificity and target gene expression to achieve high target specificity homeodomain protein form complex with other transcription factor to recognize the promoter region of a specific target gene homeodomain protein function a transcription factor due to the dna bind property of the conserved hth motif homeodomain protein be consider to be master control gene mean that a single protein can regulate expression of many target gene homeodomain protein direct the formation of the body ax and body structure during early embryonic development many homeodomain protein induce cellular differentiation by initiate the cascade of coregulated gene require to produce individual tissue and organs other protein in the family such a nanog be involve in maintain pluripotency and prevent cell differentiation hox gene and their associate micrornas be highly conserve developmental master regulator with tight spatiotemporal control these gene be know to be dysregulated in several cancer and be often control by dna methylation the regulation of hox gene be highly complex and involve reciprocal interaction mostly inhibitory drosophila be know to use the polycomb and trithorax complex to maintain the expression of hox gene after the of the and gap gene that occur during larval development protein can silence the hox gene by modulation of chromatin structure mutation to homeobox gene can produce easily visible phenotypic change in body segment identity such a the antennapedia and bithorax mutant phenotype in drosophila duplication of homeobox gene can produce new body segment and such duplication be likely to have be important in the evolution of segmented animal the homeobox itself may have evolve from a transmembrane domain at the of the mray enzyme this be base on metagenomic data acquire from the transitional archaeon lokiarchaeum that be regard a the prokaryote closest to the ancestor of all eukaryote phylogenetic analysis of homeobox gene sequence and homeodomain protein structure suggest that the last common ancestor of plant fungi and animal have at least two homeobox gene molecular evidence show that some limited number of hox gene have exist in the cnidaria since before the early true bilatera make these gene it be accept that the three major animal cluster hox parahox and nk metahox be the result of segmental duplication a first duplication create metahox and protohox the latter of which later duplicate into hox and parahox the cluster themselves be create by tandem duplication of a single homeobox gene gene duplication follow by neofunctionalization be responsible for the many homeobox gene find in eukaryote comparison of homeobox gene and gene cluster have be use to understand the evolution of genome structure and body morphology throughout metazoan hox gene be the most commonly know subset of homeobox gene they be essential metazoan gene that determine the identity of embryonic region along the axis the first vertebrate hox gene be isolate in xenopus by edward de robertis and colleague in the main interest in this set of gene stem from their unique behavior and arrangement in the genome hox gene be typically find in an organize cluster the linear order of hox gene within a cluster be directly correlate to the order they be express in both time and space during development this phenomenon be call colinearity mutation in these homeotic gene cause displacement of body segment during embryonic development this be call ectopia for example when one gene be lose the segment develop into a more anterior one while a mutation that lead to a gain of function cause a segment to develop into a more posterior one famous example be antennapedia and bithorax in drosophila which can cause the development of leg instead of antenna and the development of a duplicated thorax respectively in vertebrate the four paralog cluster be partially redundant in function but have also acquire several derived function for example hoxa and hoxd specify segment identity along the limb axis specific member of the hox family have be implicate in vascular remodel angiogenesis and disease by orchestrate change in matrix degradation integrins and component of the ecm be implicate in atherosclerosis and be proinvasive angiogenic gene that upregulate and integrins and in ec respectively induce

the dogma of molecular biology be an explanation of the flow of genetic information within a biological system it be often state a dna make rna and rna make protein although this be not it original meaning it be first state by francis crick in then publish in and in a nature paper publish in information flow in biological system a second version of the central dogma be popular but incorrect this be the simplistic dna rna protein pathway publish by james watson in the first edition of the molecular biology of the gene watson version differs from crick because watson describe a dna rna and rna protein process a the central dogma while the dogma a originally state by crick remain valid today watson version do not the dogma be a framework for understand the transfer of sequence information between biopolymers in the most common or general case in live organism there be major class of such biopolymers dna and rna both nucleic acid and protein there be conceivable direct transfer of information that can occur between these the dogma class these into group of three general transfer believe to occur normally in most cell three special transfer know to occur but only under specific condition in case of some virus or in a laboratory and three unknown transfer believe never to occur the general transfer describe the normal flow of biological information dna can be copy to dna dna replication dna information can be copy into mrna transcription and protein can be synthesize use the information in mrna a a template translation the special transfer describe rna be copy from rna rna replication dna be synthesise use an rna template reverse transcription and protein be synthesise directly from a dna template without the use of mrna the unknown transfer describe a protein be copy from a protein synthesis of rna use the primary structure of a protein a a template and dna synthesis use the primary structure of a protein a a template these be not think to naturally occur the biopolymers that comprise dna rna and poly peptide be linear polymer each monomer be connect to at most two other monomer the sequence of their monomer effectively encode information the transfer of information describe by the central dogma ideally be faithful deterministic transfer wherein one biopolymer sequence be use a a template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that be entirely dependent on the original biopolymer sequence of the three class of information transfer suggest by the dogma general special unknown dna dna rna dna protein dna dna rna rna rna protein rna rna protein dna protein protein protein dna replication in the sense that dna replication must occur if genetic material be to be provide for the progeny of any cell whether somatic or reproductive the copying from dna to dna arguably be the fundamental step in the central dogma a complex group of protein call the replisome perform the replication of the information from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand the replisome comprise a helicase that unwind the superhelix as well a the dna helix to create a replication fork ssb protein that bind open the dna to prevent it from reassociating rna primase that add a complementary rna primer to each template strand a a starting point for replication dna polymerase iii that read the exist template chain from it end to it end and add new complementary nucleotide from the end to the end of the daughter chain dna polymerase i that remove the rna primer and replaces them with dna dna ligase that join the two okazaki fragment with phosphodiester bond to produce a continuous chain this process typically take place during s phase of the cell cycle transcription transcription be the process by which the information contain in a section of dna be replicate in the form of a newly assemble piece of messenger rna mrna enzymes facilitate the process include rna polymerase and transcription factor in eukaryotic cell the primary transcript be must be process for translation to proceed processing include the addition of a cap and a tail to the chain follow by splice alternative splicing occur when appropriate increase the diversity of the protein that any single mrna can produce the product of the entire transcription process that begin with the production of the chain be a mature mrna chain translation the mature mrna find it way to a ribosome where it get translate in prokaryotic cell which have no nuclear compartment the process of transcription and translation may be link together without clear separation in eukaryotic cell the site of transcription the cell nucleus be usually separate from the site of translation the cytoplasm so the mrna must be transport out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it can be bind by ribosome the ribosome read the mrna triplet codon usually begin with an aug or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribosome binding site complex of initiation factor and elongation factor bring aminoacylated transfer rna trna into the complex match the codon in the mrna to the on the trna each trna bear the appropriate amino acid residue to add to the polypeptide chain be synthesise a the amino acid get link into the grow peptide chain the chain begin fold into the correct conformation translation end with a stop codon which may be a uaa uga or uag triplet the mrna do not contain all the information for specify the nature of the mature protein the nascent polypeptide chain release from the ribosome commonly require additional processing before the final product emerge for one thing the correct folding process be complex and vitally important for most protein it require other chaperone protein to control the form of the product some protein then excise internal segment from their own peptide chain splice the free end that border the gap in such process the inside discard section be call inteins other protein must be split into multiple section without splice some polypeptide chain need to be and others must be attach to cofactor such a haem heme before they become functional reverse transcription unusual flow of information highlight in green reverse transcription be the transfer of information from rna to dna the reverse of normal transcription this be know to occur in the case of retrovirus such a hiv as well a in eukaryote in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis it be the process by which genetic information from rna get transcribe into new dna rna replication rna replication be the copying of one rna to another many virus replicate this way the enzyme that copy rna to new rna call rna polymerase be also find in many eukaryote where they be involve in rna silence rna editing in which an rna sequence be alter by a complex of protein and a guide rna could also be see a an transfer direct translation from dna to protein direct translation from dna to protein have be demonstrate in a system in a test tube use extract from e coli that contain ribosome but not intact cell these cell fragment could synthesize protein from dna template isolate from other organism e mouse or toad and neomycin be find to enhance this effect however it be unclear whether this mechanism of translation correspond specifically to the genetic code modification after protein amino acid sequence have be translate from nucleic acid chain they can be edit by appropriate enzyme although this be a form of protein affect protein sequence not explicitly cover by the central dogma there be not many clear example where the associated concept of the two field have much to do with each other inteins an intein be a parasitic segment of a protein that be able to excise itself from the chain of amino acid a they emerge from the ribosome and rejoin the remain portion with a peptide bond in such a manner that the main protein backbone do not fall apart this be a case of a protein change it own primary sequence from the sequence originally encode by the dna of a gene additionally most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or heg domain which be capable of find a copy of the parent gene that do not include the intein nucleotide sequence on contact with the copy the heg domain initiate the dna break repair mechanism this process cause the intein sequence to be copy from the original source gene to the gene this be an example of protein directly edit dna sequence as well a increase the sequence heritable propagation methylation variation in methylation state of dna can alter gene expression level significantly methylation variation usually occur through the action of dna methylases when the change be heritable it be consider epigenetic when the change in information status be not heritable it would be a somatic epitype the effective information content have be change by mean of the action of a protein or protein on dna but the primary dna sequence be not altered prion prion be protein of particular amino acid sequence in particular conformation they propagate themselves in host cell by make conformational change in other molecule of protein with the same amino acid sequence but with a different conformation that be functionally important or detrimental to the organism once the protein have be transconformed to the prion fold it change function in turn it can convey information into new cell and reconfigure more functional molecule of that sequence into the alternate prion form in some type of prion in fungi this change be continuous and direct the information flow be protein protein some scientist such a alain bussard and eugene koonin have argue that inheritance violate the central dogma of molecular biology however rosalind ridley in molecular pathology of the prion have write that the prion hypothesis be not heretical to the central dogma of molecular the information necessary to manufacture protein be encode in the nucleotide sequence of nucleic it do not claim that proteins replicate rather it claim that there be a source of information within protein molecule that contribute to their biological function and that this information can be pass on to other molecule natural genetic engineering james shapiro argue that a superset of these example should be classify a natural genetic engineering and be sufficient to falsify the central dogma while shapiro have receive a respectful hearing for his view his critic have not be convince that his reading of the central dogma be in line with what crick intend in his autobiography what mad pursuit crick write about his choice of the word dogma and some of the problem it cause him i call this idea the central dogma for two reason i suspect i have already use the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis and in addition i want to suggest that this new assumption be more central and more powerful a it turn out the use of the word dogma cause almost more trouble than it be worth many year later jacques monod point out to me that i do not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma which be a belief that can not be doubt i do apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since i think that all religious belief be without foundation i use the word the way i myself think about it not a most of the world do and simply apply it to a grand hypothesis that however plausible have little direct experimental support similarly horace freeland judson record in the eighth day of creation my mind be that a dogma be an idea for which there be no reasonable evidence you see and crick give a roar of delight i just do know what dogma meant and i could just as well have call it the hypothesis or you know which be what i mean to say dogma be just a catch phrase in august weismann germ plasm theory the hereditary material the germ plasm be confine to the gonad somatic cell of the body develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm whatever may happen to those cell do not affect the next generation the weismann barrier propose by august weismann in distinguishes between the immortal germ cell lineages the germ plasm which produce gamete and the disposable somatic cell

this curve have wind number two around the point p in mathematics the number of a closed curve in the plane around a give point be an integer represent the total number of time that curve travel counterclockwise around the point the wind number depend on the orientation of the curve and be negative if the curve travel around the point clockwise wind number be fundamental object of study in algebraic topology and they play an important role in vector calculus complex analysis geometric topology differential geometry and physic include string theory an object traveling along the red curve make two counterclockwise turn around the person at the origin suppose we be give a closed orient curve in the xy plane we can imagine the curve a the path of motion of some object with the orientation indicate the direction in which the object move then the number of the curve be equal to the total number of counterclockwise turn that the object make around the origin when count the total number of turn counterclockwise motion count a positive while clockwise motion count a negative for example if the object first circle the origin four time counterclockwise and then circle the origin once clockwise then the total winding number of the curve be three use this scheme a curve that do not travel around the origin at all have wind number zero while a curve that travel clockwise around the origin have negative wind number therefore the wind number of a curve may be any integer the following picture show curve with wind number between and a curve in the xy plane can be define by parametric equation if we think of the parameter t a time then these equation specify the motion of an object in the plane between and the path of this motion be a curve as long a the function x t and y t be continuous this curve be close as long a the position of the object be the same at and we can define the number of such a curve use the polar coordinate system assume the curve do not pass through the origin we can rewrite the parametric equation in polar form the function r t and θ t be require to be continuous with because the initial and final position be the same θ and θ must differ by an integer multiple of π this integer be the wind number this define the wind number of a curve around the origin in the xy plane by translate the coordinate system we can extend this definition to include wind number around any point p wind number be often define in different way in various part of mathematics all of the definition below be equivalent to the one give above a simple combinatorial rule for define the wind number be propose by august ferdinand möbius in and again independently by james waddell alexander ii in any curve partition the plane into several connect region one of which be unbounded the wind number of the curve around two point in the same region be equal the winding number around any point in the unbounded region be zero finally the winding number for any two adjacent region differ by exactly the region with the large wind number appear on the left side of the curve with respect to motion down the curve in differential geometry parametric equation be usually assume to be differentiable or at least piecewise differentiable in this case the polar coordinate θ be relate to the rectangular coordinate x and y by the equation which be find by differentiate the following definition for θ by the fundamental theorem of calculus the total change in θ be equal to the integral of dθ we can therefore express the wind number of a differentiable curve a a line integral the dθ define on the complement of the origin be close but not exact and it generate the first de rham cohomology group of the punctured plane in particular if ω be any closed differentiable define on the complement of the origin then the integral of ω along closed loop give a multiple of the wind number wind number play a very important role throughout complex analysis the statement of the residue theorem in the context of complex analysis the wind number of a closed curve in the complex plane can be express in term of the complex coordinate specifically if we write z then and therefore a be a closed curve the total change in ln r be zero and thus the integral of be equal to multiply by the total change in therefore the wind number of closed path about the origin be give by the expression more generally if be a closed curve parameterized by the wind number of about also know a the index of with respect to be define for complex a this be a special case of the famous cauchy integral formula some of the basic property of the wind number in the complex plane be give by the following theorem theorem be a closed path and let be the set complement of the image of that be then the index of with respect to i for all ii constant over each component maximal connect subset of and iii zero if be in the unbounded component of a an immediate corollary this theorem give the wind number of a circular path about a point a expect the wind number count the number of counterclockwise loop make around corollary be the path define by then in topology the winding number be an alternate term for the degree of a continuous mapping in physic wind number be frequently call topological quantum number in both case the same concept apply the above example of a curve wind around a point have a simple topological interpretation the complement of a point in the plane be homotopy equivalent to the circle such that map from the circle to itself be really all that need to be consider it can be show that each such map can be continuously deform to be homotopic to one of the standard map where multiplication in the circle be define by identify it with the complex unit circle the set of homotopy class of map from a circle to a topological space form a group which be call the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space the fundamental group of the circle be the group of the integer and the wind number of a complex curve be just it homotopy class map from the to itself be also classify by an integer which be also call the winding number or sometimes pontryagin index enneagram wind around it centre time so it have a density of in polygon the winding number be refer to a the polygon density for convex polygon and more generally simple polygon not the density be by the jordan curve theorem by contrast for a regular star polygon p q the density be q one can also consider the winding number of the path with respect to the tangent of the path itself a a path follow through time this would be the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity vector in this case the example illustrate at the beginning of this article have a winding number of because the small loop be count this be only define for immersed path for differentiable path with nowhere vanish derivative and be the degree of the tangential gauss map this be call the number and can be compute a the total curvature divide by π the winding number be closely relate with the continuous heisenberg ferromagnet equation and it integrable extension the ishimori equation etc solution of the last equation be classify by the wind number or topological charge topological invariant topological quantum number argument principle

chemical structure of a polypeptide macromolecule a be a very large molecule such a protein commonly compose of the polymerization of small subunit call monomer they be typically compose of thousand of atom or more the most common macromolecule in biochemistry be biopolymers nucleic acid protein and carbohydrate and large molecule such a lipid and macrocycles synthetic fiber as well a experimental material such a carbon nanotube macromolecule be large molecule compose of thousand of covalently connect atom carbohydrate lipids protein and nucleic acid be all macromolecule macromolecule be form by many monomer link together form a polymer carbohydrate be compose of carbon oxygen and hydrogen the monomer of carbohydrate be monosaccharide there be three form of carbohydrate energy storage and structural molecule a disaccharide be form when a dehydration reaction join two monosaccharide another type of macromolecule be lipids lipid be hydrocarbon that do not form polymer fat be construct from glycerol and fatty acid phospholipid be commonly find in the phospholipid bilayer of membrane they have hydrophilic head and hydrophopic tail a protein be another type of macromolecule amino acid be the monomer of protein protein have many different function there be protein that be use for structural support storage transport cellular communication movement defense against foreign substance and more nucleic acid transmit and help express hereditary information they be make up of monomer call nucleotide two type of nucleic acid be dna and rna the term macromolecule molecule be coin by nobel laureate hermann staudinger in the although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions high molecular compound in excess of atom at that time the term polymer a introduce by berzelius in have a different meaning from that of today it simply be another form of isomerism for example with benzene and acetylene and have little to do with size usage of the term to describe large molecule varies among the discipline for example while biology refers to macromolecule a the four large molecule comprise live thing in chemistry the term may refer to aggregate of two or more molecule hold together by intermolecular force rather than covalent bond but which do not readily dissociate accord to the standard iupac definition the term macromolecule a use in polymer science refers only to a single molecule for example a single polymeric molecule be appropriately describe a a macromolecule or polymer molecule rather than a polymer which suggest a substance compose of macromolecule because of their size macromolecule be not conveniently describe in term of stoichiometry alone the structure of simple macromolecule such a homopolymers may be describe in term of the individual monomer subunit and total molecular mass complicate biomacromolecules on the other hand require structural description such a the hierarchy of structure use to describe protein in british english the word macromolecule tend to be call high polymer macromolecule often have unusual physical property that do not occur for small molecule another common macromolecular property that do not characterize small molecule be their relative insolubility in water and similar solvent instead form colloid many require salt or particular ion to dissolve in water similarly many protein will denature if the solute concentration of their solution be too high or too low high concentration of macromolecule in a solution can alter the rate and equilibrium constant of the reaction of other macromolecule through an effect know a macromolecular crowd this come from macromolecule exclude other molecule from a large part of the volume of the solution thereby increase the effective concentration of these molecule all living organism be dependent on three essential biopolymers for their biological function dna rna and proteins each of these molecule be require for life since each play a distinct indispensable role in the cell the simple summary be that dna make rna and then rna make protein dna rna and proteins all consist of a repeating structure of related building block nucleotide in the case of dna and rna amino acid in the case of protein in general they be all unbranched polymer and so can be represent in the form of a string indeed they can be view a a string of bead with each bead represent a single nucleotide or amino acid monomer link together through covalent chemical bond into a very long chain in most case the monomer within the chain have a strong propensity to interact with other amino acid or nucleotide in dna and rna this can take the form of base pair and or although many more complicated interaction can and do occur structural feature dna rna protein encode genetic information yes yes no catalyzes biological reaction no yes yes build block type nucleotide nucleotide amino acid building block number strandedness double single single structure double helix complex complex stability to degradation high variable variable repair system yes no no because of the nature of dna essentially all of the nucleotide take the form of base pair between nucleotide on the two complementary strand of the in contrast both rna and protein be normally therefore they be not constrain by the regular geometry of the dna double helix and so fold into complex shape dependent on their sequence these different shape be responsible for many of the common property of rna and proteins include the formation of specific bind pocket and the ability to catalyse biochemical reaction dna be optimise for encode information dna be an information storage macromolecule that encode the complete set of instruction the genome that be require to assemble maintain and reproduce every living organism dna and rna be both capable of encode genetic information because there be biochemical mechanism which read the information cod within a dna or rna sequence and use it to generate a specified protein on the other hand the sequence information of a protein molecule be not use by cell to functionally encode genetic information dna have three primary attribute that allow it to be far good than rna at encode genetic information first it be normally so that there be a minimum of two copy of the information encode each gene in every cell second dna have a much great stability against breakdown than do rna an attribute primarily associate with the absence of the group within every nucleotide of dna third highly sophisticated dna surveillance and repair system be present which monitor damage to the dna and repair the sequence when necessary analogous system have not evolve for repair damage rna molecule consequently chromosome can contain many billion of atom arrange in a specific chemical structure protein be optimise for catalysis protein be functional macromolecule responsible for catalyse the biochemical reaction that sustain life protein carry out all function of an organism for example photosynthesis neural function vision and movement the nature of protein molecule together with their composition of or more different amino acid building block allow them to fold in to a vast number of different shape while provide bind pocket through which they can specifically interact with all manner of molecule in addition the chemical diversity of the different amino acid together with different chemical environment afford by local structure enable many protein to act a enzyme catalyze a wide range of specific biochemical transformation within cell in addition protein have evolve the ability to bind a wide range of cofactor and coenzyme small molecule that can endow the protein with specific activity beyond those associate with the polypeptide chain alone rna be multifunctional rna be multifunctional it primary function be to encode protein accord to the instruction within a dna they control and regulate many aspect of protein synthesis in eukaryote rna encode genetic information that can be translate into the amino acid sequence of protein a evidence by the messenger rna molecule present within every cell and the rna genome of a large number of virus the nature of rna together with tendency for rapid breakdown and a lack of repair system mean that rna be not so well suit for the storage of genetic information a be dna in addition rna be a polymer that can like protein fold into a very large number of structure some of these structure provide bind site for other molecule and center that can catalyze specific chemical reaction on those bound molecule the limited number of different build block of rna nucleotide vs amino acid in protein together with their lack of chemical diversity result in catalytic rna ribozymes be generally catalyst than protein for most biological reaction the major macromolecule macromolecule polymer building block monomer bond that join them proteins amino acid peptide nucleic acid phoshodiester dna nucleotides a phoshate ribose and a adenine guanine thymine or cytosine rna nucleotides a phoshate ribose and a adenine

allosteric regulation of an enzyme in biochemistry regulation or control be the regulation of an enzyme by bind an effector molecule at a site other than the enzyme active site the site to which the effector bind be term the allosteric site or regulatory site allosteric site allow effector to bind to the protein often result in a conformational change involve protein dynamic effector that enhance the protein activity be refer to a allosteric activator whereas those that decrease the protein activity be call allosteric inhibitor allosteric regulation be a natural example of control loop such a feedback from downstream product or feedforward from upstream substrate allostery be especially important in cell signal allosteric regulation be also particularly important in the cell ability to adjust enzyme activity the term allostery come from the ancient greek allos other and stereos solid object this be in reference to the fact that the regulatory site of an allosteric protein be physically distinct from it active site a active site b allosteric site c substrate d inhibitor e enzymethis be a diagram of allosteric regulation of an enzyme many allosteric effect can be explain by the concerted mwc model put forth by monod wyman and changeux or by the sequential model describe by koshland nemethy and filmer both postulate that protein subunit exist in one of two conformation tense t or relax r and that relax subunit bind substrate more readily than those in the tense state the two model differ most in their assumption about subunit interaction and the preexistence of both state for protein in which subunit exist in more than two conformation the allostery landscape model describe by cuendet weinstein and levine can be use concerted model the concerted model of allostery also refer to a the symmetry model or mwc model postulate that enzyme subunit be connect in such a way that a conformational change in one subunit be necessarily confer to all other subunit thus all subunit must exist in the same conformation the model further hold that in the absence of any ligand substrate or otherwise the equilibrium favor one of the conformational state t or the equilibrium can be shift to the r or t state through the binding of one ligand the allosteric effector or ligand to a site that be different from the active site the allosteric site sequential model the sequential model of allosteric regulation hold that subunit be not connect in such a way that a conformational change in one induce a similar change in the others thus all enzyme subunit do not necessitate the same conformation moreover the sequential model dictate that molecule of a substrate bind via an induced fit protocol while such an induced fit convert a subunit from the tensed state to relax state it do not propagate the conformational change to adjacent subunit instead at one subunit only slightly alter the structure of other subunit so that their binding site be more receptive to substrate to summarize subunit need not exist in the same conformation molecule of substrate bind via protocol conformational change be not propagate to all subunit morpheein model the morpheein model of allosteric regulation be a dissociative concert model a morpheein be a structure that can exist a an ensemble of physiologically significant and functionally different alternate quaternary assembly transition between alternate morpheein assembly involve oligomer dissociation conformational change in the dissociated state and reassembly to a different oligomer the required oligomer disassembly step differentiate the morpheein model for allosteric regulation from the classic mwc and knf model porphobilinogen synthase pbgs be the prototype morpheein ensemble model ensemble model of allosteric regulation enumerate an allosteric system statistical ensemble a a function of it potential energy function and then relate specific statistical measurement of allostery to specific energy term in the energy function such a an intermolecular salt bridge between two domain ensemble model like the ensemble allosteric model and allosteric ising model assume that each domain of the system can adopt two state similar to the mwc model the allostery landscape model introduce by cuendet weinstein and levine allows for the domain to have any number of state and the contribution of a specific molecular interaction to a give allosteric coupling can be estimate use a rigorous set of rule molecular dynamic simulation can be use to estimate a system statistical ensemble so that it can be analyze with the allostery landscape model allosteric modulation be use to alter the activity of molecule and enzyme in biochemistry and pharmacology for comparison a typical drug be make to bind to the active site of an enzyme which thus prohibit binding of a substrate to that enzyme cause a decrease in enzyme activity allosteric modulation occur when an effector bind to an allosteric site also know a a regulatory site of an enzyme and alter the enzyme activity allosteric modulators be design to fit the allosteric site to cause a conformational change of the enzyme in particular a change in the shape of the active site which then cause a change in it activity in contrast to typical drug modulators be not competitive inhibitor they can be positive activate cause an increase of the enzyme activity or negative inhibiting cause a decrease of the enzyme activity the use of allosteric modulation allow the control of the effect of specific enzyme activity a a result allosteric modulators be very effective in pharmacology in a biological system allosteric modulation can be difficult to distinguish from modulation by substrate presentation an example of this model be see with the mycobacterium tuberculosis a bacterium that be perfectly suit to adapt to live in the macrophage of human the enzyme sit serve a a communication between different substrate specifically between amp and site like these also serve a a sensing mechanism for the enzyme performance positive modulation positive allosteric modulation also know a allosteric activation occur when the binding of one ligand enhance the attraction between substrate molecule and other bind site an example be the binding of oxygen molecule to hemoglobin where oxygen be effectively both the substrate and the effector the allosteric or other site be the active site of an adjoin protein subunit the binding of oxygen to one subunit induce a conformational change in that subunit that interact with the remain active site to enhance their oxygen affinity another example of allosteric activation be see in cytosolic specific ii where the affinity for substrate gmp increase upon gtp binding at the dimer interface negative modulation negative allosteric modulation also know a allosteric inhibition occur when the binding of one ligand decrease the affinity for substrate at other active site for example when bind to an allosteric site on hemoglobin the affinity for oxygen of all subunit decrease this be when a regulator be absent from the bind site direct thrombin inhibitor provide an excellent example of negative allosteric modulation allosteric inhibitor of thrombin have be discover that could potentially be use a anticoagulant another example be strychnine a convulsant poison which act a an allosteric inhibitor of the glycine receptor glycine be a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian spinal cord and brain stem strychnine act at a separate binding site on the glycine receptor in an allosteric manner it binding lower the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine thus strychnine inhibit the action of an inhibitory transmitter lead to convulsion another instance in which negative allosteric modulation can be see be between atp and the enzyme phosphofructokinase within the negative feedback loop that regulate glycolysis phosphofructokinase generally refer to a pfk be an enzyme that catalyse the third step of glycolysis the phosphorylation of into fructose pfk can be allosterically inhibit by high level of atp within the cell when atp level be high atp will bind to an allosteoric site on phosphofructokinase cause a change in the enzyme shape this change cause it affinity for substrate and atp at the active site to decrease and the enzyme be deem inactive this cause glycolysis to cease when atp level be high thus conserve the body glucose and maintain balanced level of cellular atp in this way atp serf a a negative allosteric modulator for pfk despite the fact that it be also a substrate of the enzyme homotropic a homotropic allosteric modulator be a substrate for it target enzyme as well a a regulatory molecule of the enzyme activity it be typically an activator of the enzyme for example and co be homotropic allosteric modulators of hemoglobin likewise in specific nucleotidase binding of one gmp molecule to a single subunit of the tetrameric enzyme lead to increase affinity for gmp by the subsequent subunit a reveal by sigmoidal substrate versus velocity plot heterotropic a heterotropic allosteric modulator be a regulatory molecule that be not the enzyme substrate it may be either an activator or an inhibitor of the enzyme for example and be heterotropic allosteric modulators of hemoglobin once again in specific nucleotidase binding of gtp molecule at the dimer interface in the tetrameric enzyme lead to increase affinity for substrate gmp at the active site indicating towards heterotropic allosteric activation a have be amply highlight above some allosteric protein can be regulate by both their substrate and other molecule such protein be capable of both homotropic and heterotropic interaction essential activator some allosteric activator be refer to a essential or obligate activator in the sense that in their absence the activity of their target enzyme activity be very low or negligible a be the case with activity on carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i for example a allosteric site be any component of an enzyme or any protein that be not itself an amino acid for instance many enzyme require sodium binding to ensure proper function however the sodium do not necessarily act a a regulatory subunit the sodium be always present and there be no known biological process to sodium to regulate enzyme activity allostery could comprise any other ion besides sodium calcium magnesium zinc as well a other chemical and possibly vitamin allosteric modulation of a receptor result from the binding of allosteric modulators at a different site a regulatory site from that of the endogenous ligand an active site and enhances or inhibit the effect of the endogenous ligand under normal circumstance it act by cause a conformational change in a receptor molecule which result in a change in the binding affinity of the ligand in this way an allosteric ligand modulate the receptor activation by it primary orthosteric ligand and can be think to act like a dimmer switch in an electrical circuit adjust the intensity of the response for example the gabaa receptor have two active site that the neurotransmitter acid gaba bind but also have benzodiazepine and general anaesthetic agent regulatory binding sit these regulatory site can each produce positive allosteric modulation potentiate the activity of gaba diazepam be an positive allosteric modulator at the benzodiazepine regulatory site and it antidote flumazenil be an antagonist more recent example of drug that allosterically modulate their target include the cinacalcet and the hiv treatment maraviroc allosteric site a drug target allosteric site may represent a novel drug target there be a number of advantage in use allosteric modulators a preferred therapeutic agent over classic orthosteric ligand for example g receptor gpcr allosteric binding site have not face the same evolutionary pressure a site to accommodate an endogenous ligand so be more diverse therefore great gpcr selectivity may be obtain by target allosteric site this be particularly useful for gpcrs where selective orthosteric therapy have be difficult because of sequence conservation of the orthosteric site across receptor subtypes also these modulators have a decrease potential for toxic effect since modulators with limited will have a ceiling level to their effect irrespective of the administer dose another type of pharmacological selectivity that be unique to allosteric modulators be base on an allosteric modulator may display neutral with an orthosteric ligand at all subtypes of a give receptor except the subtype of interest which be term absolute subtype selectivity if an allosteric modulator do not possess appreciable efficacy it can provide another powerful therapeutic advantage over orthosteric ligand namely the ability to selectively tune up or down tissue response only when the endogenous agonist be present small molecule binding site be drug target for medically relevant morpheeins there be many synthetic compound contain several noncovalent binding site which exhibit conformational change upon occupation of one site cooperativity between single bind contribution in such supramolecular system be positive if occupation of one bind site enhance the affinity δ g at a second site and negative if the affinity be highered most synthetic allosteric complex rely on conformational reorganization upon the binding of one effector ligand which then lead to either enhance or weaken association of second ligand at another bind site conformational coupling between several bind site be in artificial system usually much large than in protein with their usually large flexibility the parameter which determine the efficiency a measure by the ratio of equilibrium constant krel ka e in presence and absence of an effector e be the conformational energy need to adopt a closed or strained conformation for the binding of a ligand a in many multivalent supramolecular system direct interaction between bound ligand can occur which can lead to large cooperativities most common be such a direct interaction between ion in receptor for this cooperatitiy be often also refer to a allostery even though conformational change here be not necessarily trigger bind event allosteric database allostery be a direct and efficient mean for regulation of biological macromolecule function produce by the binding of a ligand at an allosteric site topographically distinct from the orthosteric site due to the often high receptor selectivity and low toxicity allosteric regulation be also expect to play an increase role in drug discovery and bioengineering the allosteric database asd http provide a central resource for the display search and analysis of the structure function and related annotation for allosteric molecule currently asd contains allosteric protein from more than specie and modulators in three category activator inhibitor and regulator each protein be annotate with detailed description of allostery biological process and related disease and each modulator with bind affinity physicochemical property and therapeutic area integrate the information of allosteric protein in asd should allow the prediction of allostery for unknown protein to be follow with experimental validation in addition modulators curated in asd can be use to investigate potential allosteric target for a query compound and can help chemist to implement structure modification for novel allosteric drug design allosteric residue and their prediction not all protein residue play equally important role in allosteric regulation the identification of residue that be essential to allostery have be the focus of many study especially within the last decade in part this grow interest be a result of their general importance in protein science but also because allosteric residue may be exploit in biomedical context pharmacologically important protein with site may yield to approach in which one alternatively target residue that be capable of allosterically regulate the primary site of interest these residue can broadly be classify a and amino acid allosteric site at the surface generally play regulatory role that be fundamentally distinct from those within the interior surface residue may serve a receptor or effector site in allosteric signal transmission whereas those within the interior may act to transmit such signal asd database competitive inhibition

the law of thermodynamics state that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time and be constant if and only if all process be reversible isolated system spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium the state with maximum entropy the total entropy of a system and it surroundings can remain constant in ideal case where the system be in thermodynamic equilibrium or be undergo a fictive reversible process in all process that occur include spontaneous process the total entropy of the system and it surroundings increase and the process be irreversible in the thermodynamic sense the increase in entropy account for the irreversibility of natural process and the asymmetry between future and past historically the second law be an empirical finding that be accept a an axiom of thermodynamic theory statistical mechanic classical or quantum explain the microscopic origin of the law the second law have be express in many way it first formulation be credit to the french scientist sadi carnot who in show that there be an upper limit to the efficiency of conversion of heat to work in a heat engine this aspect of the second law be also know a carnot rule or limit heat flow from hot water to cold water the first law of thermodynamics provide the definition of the internal energy of a thermodynamic system and express the law of conservation of energy the second law be concern with the direction of natural process it assert that a natural process run only in one sense and be not reversible for example when a path for conduction and radiation be make available heat always flow spontaneously from a hotter to a colder body such phenomenon be account for in term of entropy if an isolated system be hold initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning impermeable wall and then some operation make the wall more permeable then the system spontaneously evolve to reach a final new internal thermodynamic equilibrium and it total entropy increase in a fictive reversible process an infinitesimal increment in the entropy of a system be define to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat to a closed system which allow the entry or exit of energy but not transfer of matter divide by the common temperature of the system in equilibrium and the surroundings which supply the heat different notation be use for infinitesimal amount of heat and infinitesimal amount of entropy because entropy be a function of state while heat like work be not for an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of mass with the surroundings the second law require that the increment in system entropy fulfill the inequality this be because a general process for this case may include work be do on the system by it surroundings which can have frictional or viscous effect inside the system because a chemical reaction may be in progress or because heat transfer actually occur only irreversibly drive by a finite difference between the system temperature and the temperature of the surroundings surr note that the equality still apply for pure heat flow which be the basis of the accurate determination of the absolute entropy of pure substance from measure heat capacity curve and entropy change at phase transition by calorimetry introduce a set of internal variable to describe the deviation of a thermodynamic system in physical equilibrium with the required uniform pressure p and temperature t from the chemical equilibrium state one can record the equality the second term represent work of internal variable that can be perturb by external influence but the system can not perform any positive work via internal variable this statement introduce the impossibility of the reversion of evolution of the thermodynamic system in time and can be consider a a formulation of the second principle of thermodynamics the formulation which be of course equivalent to the formulation of the principle in term of entropy the zeroth law of thermodynamics in it usual short statement allow recognition that two body in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature especially that a test body have the same temperature a a reference thermometric body for a body in thermal equilibrium with another there be indefinitely many empirical temperature scale in general respectively depend on the property of a particular reference thermometric body the second law allow a distinguished temperature scale which define an absolute thermodynamic temperature independent of the property of any particular reference thermometric body the second law of thermodynamics may be express in many specific way the most prominent classical statement be the statement by rudolf clausius the statement by lord kelvin and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by constantin carathéodory these statement cast the law in general physical term cite the impossibility of certain process the clausius and the kelvin statement have be show to be equivalent the historical origin of the second law of thermodynamics be in carnot principle it refer to a cycle of a carnot heat engine fictively operate in the limiting mode of extreme slowness know a so that the heat and work transfer be between subsystem that be always in their own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium the carnot engine be an idealized device of special interest to engineer who be concern with the efficiency of heat engine carnot principle be recognize by carnot at a time when the caloric theory of heat be seriously consider before the recognition of the first law of thermodynamics and before the mathematical expression of the concept of entropy interpret in the light of the first law it be physically equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics and remain valid today carnot original argument be make from the viewpoint of the caloric theory before the discovery of the first law of thermodynamics some sample from his book be there exist a difference of temperature motive power can be produce production of motive power be then due in steam engine not to an actual consumption of caloric but to it transportation from a warm body to a cold body the motive power of heat be independent of the agent employ to realize it it quantity be fix solely by the temperature of the body between which be effect finally the transfer of caloric in modern term carnot principle may be state more precisely efficiency of a or reversible carnot cycle depend only on the temperature of the two heat reservoir and be the same whatever the work substance a carnot engine operate in this way be the most efficient possible heat engine use those two temperature the german scientist rudolf clausius lay the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in by examine the relation between heat transfer and work his formulation of the second law which be publish in german in be know a the clausius statement heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change connect therewith occur at the same time the statement by clausius use the concept of of heat a be usual in thermodynamic discussion this mean transfer of energy a heat and do not refer to contributory transfer one way and the other heat can not spontaneously flow from cold region to hot region without external work be perform on the system which be evident from ordinary experience of refrigeration for example in a refrigerator heat flow from cold to hot but only when force by an external agent the refrigeration system lord kelvin express the second law in several wording be impossible for a machine unaided by any external agency to convey heat from one body to another at a high temperature be impossible by mean of inanimate material agency to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cool it below the temperature of the coldest of the surround object of the clausius and the kelvin derive kelvin statement from clausius statement suppose there be an engine violate the kelvin statement one that drain heat and convert it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without any other result now pair it with a reversed carnot engine a show by the figure the efficiency of a normal heat engine be η and so the efficiency of the reversed heat engine be the net and sole effect of the combined pair of engine be to transfer heat from the cooler reservoir to the hotter one which violate the clausius statement this be a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics a for the total system energy to remain the same so therefore thus a violation of the kelvin statement imply a violation of the clausius statement the clausius statement imply the kelvin statement we can prove in a similar manner that the kelvin statement imply the clausius statement and hence the two be equivalent planck offer the following proposition a derive directly from experience this be sometimes regard a his statement of the second law but he regard it a a starting point for the derivation of the second law be impossible to construct an engine which will work in a complete cycle and produce no effect except the raising of a weight and cooling of a heat reservoir between kelvin statement and planck it be almost customary in textbook to speak of the statement of the law a for example in the text by ter haar and wergeland the statement or the heat engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics state that be impossible to devise a cyclically operate device the sole effect of which be to absorb energy in the form of heat from a single thermal reservoir and to deliver an equivalent amount of work planck state the second law a follow process occur in nature proceeds in the sense in which the sum of the entropy of all body take part in the process be increase in the limit for reversible process the sum of the entropy remain unchanged rather like planck statement be that of uhlenbeck and ford for irreversible phenomenon in an irreversible or spontaneous change from one equilibrium state to another a for example the equalization of temperature of two body a and b when brought in contact the entropy always increase of constantin carathéodory formulate thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic foundation his statement of the second law be know a the principle of carathéodory which may be formulate a follow in every neighborhood of any state s of an adiabatically enclosed system there be state inaccessible from with this formulation he describe the concept of adiabatic accessibility for the first time and provide the foundation for a new subfield of classical thermodynamics often call geometrical thermodynamics it follow from carathéodory principle that quantity of energy transfer a heat be a holonomic process function in other word though it be almost customary in textbook to say that carathéodory principle express the second law and to treat it a equivalent to the clausius or to the statement such be not the case to get all the content of the second law carathéodory principle need to be supplement by planck principle that isochoric work always increase the internal energy of a closed system that be initially in it own internal thermodynamic equilibrium in max planck write an important paper on the basic of thermodynamics he indicate the principle internal energy of a closed system be increase by an adiabatic process throughout the duration of which the volume of the system remain constant this formulation do not mention heat and do not mention temperature nor even entropy and do not necessarily implicitly rely on those concept but it imply the content of the second law a closely related statement be that frictional pressure never do positive work planck write the production of heat by friction be irreversible not mention entropy this principle of planck be state in physical term it be very closely relate to the kelvin statement give just above it be relevant that for a system at constant volume and mole number the entropy be a monotonic function of the internal energy nevertheless this principle of planck be not actually planck preferred statement of the second law which be quote above in a previous of the present section of this present article and relies on the concept of entropy a statement that in a sense be complementary to planck principle be make by borgnakke and sonntag they do not offer it a a full statement of the second law there be only one way in which the entropy of a closed system can be decrease and that be to transfer heat from the system differ from planck just forego principle this one be explicitly in term of entropy change removal of matter from a system can also decrease it entropy for a system that have a know expression of it internal energy a a function of it extensive state the second law have be show to be equivalent to the internal energy u be a weakly convex function when write a a function of extensive property mass volume entropy motion of the second before the establishment of the second law many people who be interested in invent a perpetual motion machine have try to circumvent the restriction of first law of thermodynamics by extract the massive internal energy of the environment a the power of the machine such a machine be call a perpetual motion machine of the second kind the second law declare the impossibility of such machine carnot theorem be a principle that limit the maximum efficiency for any possible engine the efficiency solely depend on the temperature difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoir carnot theorem state irreversible heat engine between two heat reservoir be less efficient than a carnot engine operate between the same reservoir reversible heat engine between two heat reservoir be equally efficient with a carnot engine operate between the same reservoir in his ideal model the heat of caloric convert into work could be reinstate by reverse the motion of the cycle a concept subsequently know a thermodynamic reversibility carnot however far postulate that some caloric be lose not be convert to mechanical work hence no real heat engine could realise the carnot cycle reversibility and be condemn to be less efficient though formulate in term of caloric see the obsolete caloric theory rather than entropy this be an early insight into the second law the clausius theorem state that in a cyclic process the equality hold in the reversible case and the strict inequality hold in the irreversible case the reversible case be use to introduce the state function entropy this be because in cyclic process the variation of a state function be zero from state functionality for an arbitrary heat engine the efficiency be where w n be for the net work do per cycle thus the efficiency depend only on carnot theorem state that all reversible engine operate between the same heat reservoir be equally efficient thus any reversible heat engine operate between temperature t and t must have the same efficiency that be to say the efficiency be the function of temperature only in addition a reversible heat engine operate between temperature t and t must have the same efficiency a one consist of two cycle one between t and another intermediate temperature t and the second between t and t this can only be the case if now consider the case where be a fixed reference temperature the temperature of the triple point of water then for any t and t therefore if thermodynamic temperature be define by then the function f view a a function of thermodynamic temperature be simply and the reference temperature t will have the value any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be usedthe choice here correspond to the kelvin scale accord to the clausius equality for a reversible process that mean the line integral be path independent for reversible process so we can define a state function s call entropy which for a reversible process or for pure heat transfer satisfy with this we can only obtain the difference of entropy by integrate the above formula to obtain the absolute value we need the third law of thermodynamics which state that s at absolute zero for perfect crystal for any irreversible process since entropy be a state function we can always connect the initial and terminal state with an imaginary reversible process and integrate on that path to calculate the difference in entropy now reverse the reversible process and combine it with the say irreversible process apply the clausius inequality on this loop thus where the equality hold if the transformation be reversible notice that if the process be an adiabatic process then so available useful an important and reveal idealize special case be to consider apply the second law to the scenario of an isolated system call the total system or universe make up of two part a of interest and the surroundings these surroundings be imagine to be so large that they can be consider a an unlimited heat reservoir at temperature tr and pressure pr so that no matter how much heat be transfer to or from the the temperature of the surroundings will remain tr and no matter how much the volume of the expands or contract the pressure of the surroundings will remain pr whatever change to ds and dsr occur in the entropy of the and the surroundings individually accord to the second law the entropy stot of the isolated total system must not decrease accord to the first law of thermodynamics the change du in the internal energy of the be the sum of the heat δq add to the less any work δw do by the plus any net chemical energy enter the d so that where μir be the chemical potential of chemical specie in the external surroundings now the heat leave the reservoir and enter the be where we have first use the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics alternatively in statistical thermodynamics the relation between entropy change temperature and absorbed heat can be derive and then the second law inequality from above it therefore follow that any net work δw do by the must obey it be useful to separate the work δw do by the subsystem into the useful work δwu that can be do by the over and beyond the work pr dv do merely by the expand against the surrounding external pressure give the following relation for the useful work exergy that can be do it be convenient to define the a the exact derivative of a thermodynamic potential call the availability or exergy e of the subsystem the second law therefore implies that for any process which can be consider a divide simply into a subsystem and an unlimited temperature and pressure reservoir with which it be in contact the change in the subsystem exergy plus the useful work do by the subsystem or the change in the subsystem exergy less any work additional to that do by the pressure reservoir do on the system must be less than or equal to zero in sum if a proper reference state be choose a the system surroundings in the real world then the second law predict a decrease in e for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process be equivalent to this expression together with the associate reference state permit a design engineer work at the macroscopic scale above the thermodynamic limit to utilize the second law without directly measure or consider entropy change in a total isolated system also see process engineer those change have already be consider by the assumption that the system under consideration can reach equilibrium with the reference state without alter the reference state an efficiency for a process or collection of process that compare it to the reversible ideal may also be find see second law efficiency this approach to the second law be widely utilize in engineering practice environmental account system ecology and other discipline second law in chemical for a spontaneous chemical process in a closed system at constant temperature and pressure without pv work the clausius inequality δ s transforms into a condition for the change in gibbs free energy or d g for a similar process at constant temperature and volume the change in helmholtz free energy must be negative thus a negative value of the change in free energy g or a be a necessary condition for a process to be spontaneous this be the most useful form of the second law of thermodynamics in chemistry where change can be calculate from tabulated enthalpy of formation and standard molar entropy of reactant and product the chemical equilibrium condition at constant t and p without electrical work be d g nicolas léonard sadi carnot in the traditional uniform of a student of the école polytechnique the first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work be due to nicolas léonard sadi carnot in he be the first to realize correctly that the efficiency of this conversion depend on the difference of temperature between an engine and it environment recognize the significance of james prescott joule work on the conservation of energy rudolf clausius be the first to formulate the second law during in this form heat do not flow spontaneously from cold to hot body while common knowledge now this be contrary to the caloric theory of heat popular at the time which consider heat a a fluid from there he be able to infer the principle of sadi carnot and the definition of entropy establish during the century the statement of the second law say it be impossible for any device that operate on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work this be show to be equivalent to the statement of clausius the ergodic hypothesis be also important for the boltzmann approach it say that over long period of time the time spend in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy be proportional to the volume of this region that all accessible microstates be equally probable over a long period of time equivalently it say that time average and average over the statistical ensemble be the same there be a traditional doctrine start with clausius that entropy can be understand in term of molecular within a macroscopic system this doctrine be obsolescent give by rudolf clausius in the german physicist rudolf clausius state what he call the second fundamental theorem in the mechanical theory of heat in the following form where q be heat t be temperature and n be the of all uncompensated transformation involve in a cyclical process later in clausius would come to define a entropy on the heel of this definition that same year the most famous version of the second law be read in a presentation at the philosophical society of zurich on april in which in the end of his presentation clausius conclude the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum this statement be the phrasing of the second law because of the looseness of it language universe as well a lack of specific condition open close or isolate many people take this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to every subject imaginable this be not true this statement be only a simplified version of a more extended and precise description in term of time variation the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergo an arbitrary transformation be where s be the entropy of the system and t be time the equality sign applies after equilibration an alternative way of formulating of the second law for isolated system be with with the sum of the rate of entropy production by all process inside the system the advantage of this formulation be that it show the effect of the entropy production the rate of entropy production be a very important concept since it determine limit the efficiency of thermal machine multiply with ambient temperature it give the dissipated energy the expression of the second law for closed system so allow heat exchange and move boundary but not exchange of matter be with here be the heat flow into the system be the temperature at the point where the heat enter the system the equality sign hold in the case that only reversible process take place inside the system if irreversible process take place which be the case in real system in operation the hold if heat be supply to the system at several place we have to take the algebraic sum of the corresponding term for open system also allow exchange of matter with here be the flow of entropy into the system associate with the flow of matter enter the system it should not be confuse with the time derivative of the entropy if matter be supply at several place we have to take the algebraic sum of these contribution statistical mechanic give an explanation for the second law by postulate that a material be compose of atom and molecule which be in constant motion a particular set of position and velocity for each particle in the system be call a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion the system be constantly change it microstate statistical mechanic postulate that in equilibrium each microstate that the system might be in be equally likely to occur and when this assumption be make it lead directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense that be the second law will hold on average with a statistical variation on the order of where n be the number of particle in the system for everyday macroscopic situation the probability that the second law will be violate be practically zero however for system with a small number of particle thermodynamic parameter include the entropy may show significant statistical deviation from that predict by the second law classical thermodynamic theory do not deal with these statistical variation the first mechanical argument of the kinetic theory of gas that molecular collision entail an equalization of temperature and hence a tendency towards equilibrium be due to james clerk maxwell in ludwig boltzmann with his of also argue that due to collision gas should over time tend toward the distribution due to loschmidt paradox derivation of the second law have to make an assumption regard the past namely that the system be uncorrelated at some time in the past this allow for simple probabilistic treatment this assumption be usually think a a boundary condition and thus the second law be ultimately a consequence of the initial condition somewhere in the past probably at the beginning of the universe the big bang though other scenario have also be suggest give these assumption in statistical mechanic the second law be not a postulate rather it be a consequence of the fundamental postulate also know a the equal prior probability postulate so long a one be clear that simple probability argument be apply only to the future while for the past there be auxiliary source of information which tell u that it be low entropy the first part of the second law which state that the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase be a trivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate if we restrict the notion of the entropy to system in thermal equilibrium the entropy of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium contain an amount of energy of be where be the number of quantum state in a small interval between and here be a macroscopically small energy interval that be keep fixed strictly speak this mean that the entropy depend on the choice of however in the thermodynamic limit in the limit of infinitely large system size the specific entropy entropy per unit volume or per unit mass do not depend on suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state be specify by a number of variable these macroscopic variable can refer to the total volume the position of piston in the system etc then will depend on the value of these variable if a variable be not fix we do not clamp a piston in a certain position then because all the accessible state be equally likely in equilibrium the free variable in equilibrium will be such that be maximize a that be the most probable situation in equilibrium if the variable be initially fix to some value then upon release and when the new equilibrium have be reach the fact the variable will adjust itself so that be maximized implies that the entropy will have increase or it will have stay the same if the value at which the variable be fix happen to be the equilibrium value suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a constraint on a variable then right after we do this there be a number of accessible microstates but equilibrium have not yet be reach so the actual probability of the system be in some accessible state be not yet equal to the prior probability of we have already see that in the final equilibrium state the entropy will have increase or have stay the same relative to the previous equilibrium state boltzmann however prove that the quantity increase monotonically a a function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state of the entropy change for reversible the second part of the second law state that the entropy change of a system undergo a reversible process be give by where the temperature be define a see here for the justification for this definition suppose that the system have some external parameter x that can be change in general the energy eigenstates of the system will depend on x accord to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanic in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system hamiltonian the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change it energy accord to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it be in the generalized force x correspond to the external variable x be define such that be the work perform by the system if x be increase by an amount dx if x be the volume then x be the pressure the generalize force for a system know to be in energy eigenstate be give by since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of we define the generalized force for the system a the expectation value of the above expression to evaluate the average we partition the energy eigenstates by count how many of them have a value for within a range between and call this number we have the average define the generalized force can now be write we can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to x at constant energy e a follow suppose we change x to x dx then will change because the energy eigenstates depend on x cause energy eigenstates to move into or out of the range between and let focus again on the energy eigenstates for which lie within the range between and since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by y dx all such energy eigenstates that be in the interval ranging from e y dx to e move from below e to above there be such energy eigenstates if all these energy eigenstates will move into the range between and and contribute to an increase in the number of energy eigenstates that move from below to above be give by the difference be thus the net contribution to the increase in note that if y dx be large than there will be the energy eigenstates that move from below e to above they be count in both and therefore the above expression be also valid in that case express the above expression a a derivative with respect to e and sum over y yield the expression the logarithmic derivative of with respect to x be thus give by the first term be intensive it do not scale with system size in contrast the last term scale a the inverse system size and will thus vanishes in the thermodynamic limit we have thus find that combine this with give for system describe by the canonical if a system be in thermal contact with a heat bath at some temperature t then in equilibrium the probability distribution over the energy eigenvalue be give by the canonical ensemble here z be a factor that normalize the sum of all the probability to this function be know a the partition function we now consider an infinitesimal reversible change in the temperature and in the external parameter on which the energy level depend it follow from the general formula for the entropy that insert the formula for for the canonical ensemble in here give there be two principal way of formulate thermodynamics a through passage from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another and b through cyclic process by which the system be leave unchanged while the total entropy of the surroundings be increase these two way help to understand the process of life this topic be mostly beyond the scope of this present article but have be consider by several author such a erwin schrödinger léon brillouin and isaac asimov it be also the topic of current research to a fair approximation live organism may be consider a example of b approximately an animal physical state cycle by the day leave the animal nearly unchanged animal take in food water and oxygen and a a result of metabolism give out breakdown product and heat plant take in radiative energy from the sun which may be regard a heat and carbon dioxide and water they give out oxygen in this way they grow eventually they die and their remains rot away turn mostly back into carbon dioxide and water this can be regard a a cyclic process overall the sunlight be from a high temperature source the sun and it energy be pass to a low temperature sink radiate into space this be an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant thus animal and plant obey the second law of thermodynamics consider in term of cyclic process simple concept of efficiency of heat engine be hardly applicable to this problem because they assume closed system from the thermodynamic viewpoint that consider a passage from one equilibrium state to another only a roughly approximate picture appear because living organism be never in state of thermodynamic equilibrium living organism must often be consider a open system because they take in nutrient and give out waste product thermodynamics of open system be currently often consider in term of passage from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another or in term of flow in the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium the problem for live organism may be far simplify by the approximation of assume a steady state with unchanging flow general principle of entropy production for such approximation be subject to unsettled current debate or research nevertheless idea derive from this viewpoint on the second law of thermodynamics be enlighten about living creature in system that do not require for their description the general theory of relativity body always have positive heat capacity meaning that the temperature rise with energy therefore when energy flow from a object to a object the source temperature be decrease while the sink temperature be increase hence temperature difference tend to diminish over time this be not always the case for system in which the gravitational force be important and the general theory of relativity be require such system can spontaneously change towards uneven spread of mass and energy this apply to the universe in large scale and consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to it beyond this the thermodynamics of system describe by the general theory of relativity be beyond the scope of the present article the theory of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics be idealize a main postulate or assumption often not even explicitly state be the existence of system in their own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium in general a region of space contain a physical system at a give time that may be find in nature be not in thermodynamic equilibrium read in the most stringent term in looser term nothing in the entire universe be or have ever be truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium for purpose of physical analysis it be often enough convenient to make an assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium such an assumption may rely on trial and error for it justification if the assumption be justified it can often be very valuable and useful because it make available the theory of thermodynamics element of the equilibrium assumption be that a system be observe to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time and that there be so many particle in a system that it particulate nature can be entirely ignore under such an equilibrium assumption in general there be no macroscopically detectable fluctuation there be an exception the case of critical state which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of critical opalescence for laboratory study of critical state exceptionally long observation time be need in all case the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium once make implies a a consequence that no putative candidate fluctuation alter the entropy of the system it can easily happen that a physical system exhibit internal macroscopic change that be fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of the entropy or that a physical system have so few particle that the particulate nature be manifest in observable fluctuation then the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium be to be abandon there be no unqualified general definition of entropy for state there be intermediate case in which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium be a very good approximation but strictly speak it be still an approximation not theoretically ideal for situation in general it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definition of other quantity that may be conveniently call but they should not be confuse or conflate with thermodynamic entropy properly define for the second law these other quantity indeed belong to statistical mechanic not to thermodynamics the primary realm of the second law the physic of macroscopically observable fluctuation be beyond the scope of this article thermodynamic asymmetry in time the second law of thermodynamics be a physical law that be not symmetric to reversal of the time direction this do not conflict with notion that have be observe of the fundamental law of physic namely cpt symmetry since the second law applies statistically it be hypothesize on boundary condition the second law have be propose to supply a partial explanation of the difference between move forward and backwards in time such a why the cause precede the effect the causal arrow of time irreversibility in thermodynamic process be a consequence of the asymmetric character of thermodynamic operation and not of any internally irreversible microscopic property of the body thermodynamic operation be macroscopic external intervention impose on the participate body not derive from their internal property there be repute paradox that arise from failure to recognize this loschmidt paradox also know a the reversibility paradox be the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the dynamic that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system in the opinion of schrödinger it be now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropyor for that matter all other irreversible statementsso that they be capable of be derive from reversible model you must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two which you may for the moment consider isolate from the rest of the world but not always from each other the two system be isolate from each other by the wall until it be remove by the thermodynamic operation a envisage by the law the thermodynamic operation be externally impose not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical law that govern the constituent of the system it be the cause of the irreversibility the statement of the law in this present article complies with schrödinger advice the relation be logically prior to the second law not derive from it recurrence the poincaré recurrence theorem consider a theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system this may be consider a a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation have remove an internal wall the system will after a sufficiently long time return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one the poincaré recurrence time be the length of time elapse until the return it be exceedingly long likely longer than the life of the universe and depend sensitively on the geometry of the wall that be remove by the thermodynamic operation the recurrence theorem may be perceive a apparently contradict the second law of thermodynamics more obviously however it be simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system form by removal of a wall between two system for a typical thermodynamical system the recurrence time be so large many many time longer than the lifetime of the universe that for all practical purpose one can not observe the recurrence one might wish nevertheless to imagine that one could wait for the poincaré recurrence and then the wall that be remove by the thermodynamic operation it be then evident that the appearance of irreversibility be due to the utter unpredictability of the poincaré recurrence give only that the initial state be one of thermodynamic equilibrium a be the case in macroscopic thermodynamics even if one could wait for it one have no practical possibility of pick the right instant at which to the wall the poincaré recurrence theorem provide a solution to loschmidt paradox if an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitor over increasingly many multiple of the average poincaré recurrence time the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal james clerk maxwell james clerk maxwell imagined one container divide into two part a and b both part be fill with the same gas at equal temperature and place next to each other separate by a wall observe the molecule on both side an imaginary demon guard a microscopic trapdoor in the wall when a molecule from a fly towards the trapdoor the demon open it and the molecule will fly from a to b the average speed of the molecule in b will have increase while in a they will have slow down on average since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature the temperature decrease in a and increase in b contrary to the second law of thermodynamics one response to this question be suggest in by leó szilárd and later by léon brillouin szilárd point out that a maxwell demon would need to have some mean of measure molecular speed and that the act of acquire information would require an expenditure of energy maxwell repeatedly alter the permeability of the wall between a and b it be therefore

the discarded exoskeleton exuviae of dragonfly nymph exoskeleton of cicada attach to a tridax procumbens an from greek έξω éxō outer and σκελετός skeletós skeleton be the external skeleton that support and protect an animal body in contrast to the internal skeleton endoskeleton of for example a human in usage some of the large kind of exoskeleton be know a shell example of animal with exoskeleton include insect such a grasshopper and cockroach and crustacean such a crab and lobster as well a the shell of certain sponge and the various group of shelled mollusc include those of snail clam tusk shell chiton and nautilus some animal such a the tortoise have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton exoskeleton contain rigid and resistant component that fulfill a set of functional role in many animal include protection excretion sense support feeding and act a a barrier against desiccation in terrestrial organism exoskeleton have a role in defense from pest and predator support and in provide an attachment framework for musculature exoskeleton contain chitin the addition of calcium carbonate make them hard and strong ingrowth of the arthropod exoskeleton know as serve a attachment site for muscle these structure be compose of chitin and be approximately six time strong and twice the stiffness of vertebrate tendon similar to tendon apodeme can stretch to store elastic energy for jump notably in locust calcium carbonate constitute the shell of mollusc brachiopod and some polychaete worm silica form the exoskeleton in the microscopic diatom and radiolaria one specie of mollusc the gastropod even make use of the iron sulfides greigite and pyrite some organism such a some foraminifera agglutinate exoskeleton by stick grain of sand and shell to their exterior contrary to a common misconception echinoderm do not possess an exoskeleton a their test be always contain within a layer of live tissue exoskeleton have evolve independently many time lineages evolve calcified exoskeleton alone far other lineage have produce tough outer coating analogous to an exoskeleton such a some mammal this coating be construct from bone in the armadillo and hair in the pangolin the armor of reptile like turtle and dinosaur like ankylosaur be construct of bone crocodile have bony scute and horny scale since exoskeleton be rigid they present some limit to growth organism with open shell can grow by add new material to the aperture of their shell a be the case in snails bivalve and other molluscans a true exoskeleton like that find in arthropod must be shed moult when it be outgrow a new exoskeleton be produce beneath the old one a the old one be shed the new skeleton be soft and pliable the animal will pump itself up to expand the new shell to maximal size then let it harden when the shell have set the empty space inside the new skeleton can be fill up a the animal eat failure to shed the exoskeleton once outgrow can result in the animal be suffocate within it own shell and will stop subadults from reach maturity thus prevent them from reproduce this be the mechanism behind some insect pesticide such a azadirachtin boring in exoskeleton can provide evidence of animal behavior in this case bore sponge attack this hard clam shell after the death of the clam produce the trace fossil entobia exoskeleton a hard part of organism be greatly useful in assist preservation of organism whose soft part usually rot before they can be fossilize mineralized exoskeleton can be preserve as be a shell fragment for example the possession of an exoskeleton also permit a couple of other route to fossilization for instance the tough layer can resist compaction allow a mold of the organism to be form underneath the skeleton which may later decay alternatively exceptional preservation may result in chitin be mineralize a in the burgess shale or transform to the resistant polymer keratin which can resist decay and be recover however our dependence on fossilized skeleton also significantly limit our understanding of evolution only the part of organism that be already mineralize be usually preserve such a the shell of mollusc it help that exoskeleton often contain muscle scar mark where muscle have be attach to the exoskeleton which may allow the reconstruction of much of an organism internal part from it exoskeleton alone the most significant limitation be that although there be phylum of living animal of these phylum have never be find a fossil because most animal specie be and decay before they can become fossilized mineralized skeleton first appear in the fossil record shortly before the base of the cambrian period the evolution of a mineralized exoskeleton be see by some a a possible drive force of the cambrian explosion of animal life result in a diversification of predatory and defensive tactic however some precambrian ediacaran organism produce tough outer shell while others such a cloudina have a calcify exoskeleton some cloudina shell even show evidence of predation in the form of boring on the whole the fossil record only contain mineralised exoskeleton since these be by far the most durable since most lineage with exoskeleton be think to have start out with a exoskeleton which they later mineralised this make it difficult to comment on the very early evolution of each lineage exoskeleton it be know however that in a very short course of time just before the cambrian period exoskeleton make of various material silica calcium phosphate calcite aragonite and even mineral flake spring up in a range of different environment most lineage adopt the form of calcium carbonate which be stable in the ocean at the time they first mineralised and do not change from this mineral morph even when it become the less favorable some precambrian ediacaran organism produce tough but out shell while others such a cloudina have a calcified exoskeleton but mineralized skeleton do not become common until the beginning of the cambrian period with the rise of the small shelly fauna just after the base of the cambrian these miniature fossils become diverse and abundant this abruptness may be an illusion since the chemical condition which preserve the small shellies appear at the same time most other organisms appear during the cambrian period with the bryozoan be the only calcifying phylum to appear later in the ordovician the sudden appearance of shell have be link to a change in ocean chemistry which make the calcium compound of which the shell be construct stable enough to be precipitate into a shell however this be unlikely to be a sufficient cause a the main construction cost of shell be in create the protein and polysaccharide require for the shell composite structure not in the precipitation of the mineral component skeletonization also appear at almost exactly the same time that animal start burrow to avoid predation and one of the early exoskeleton be make of mineral flake suggest that skeletonization be likewise a response to increase pressure from predator ocean chemistry may also control which mineral shell be construct of calcium carbonate have two form the stable calcite and the metastable aragonite which be stable within a reasonable range of chemical environment but rapidly become unstable outside this range when the ocean contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compare to calcium aragonite be more stable but a the magnesium concentration drop it become less stable hence harder to incorporate into an exoskeleton a it will tend to dissolve with the exception of the mollusc whose shell often comprise both form most lineage use just one form of the mineral the form use appear to reflect the seawater chemistry thus which form be more easily precipitate at the time that the lineage first evolve a calcified skeleton and do not change thereafter however the relative abundance of and lineage do not reflect subsequent seawater chemistry the ratio of the ocean appear to have a negligible impact on organism success which be instead control mainly by how well they recover from mass extinction a recently discover modern gastropod chrysomallon squamiferum that live near hydrothermal vent illustrate the influence of both ancient and modern local chemical environment it shell be make of aragonite which be find in some of the early fossil mollusk but it also have armor plate on the side of it foot and these be mineralize with the iron sulfides pyrite and greigite which have never previously be find in any metazoan but whose ingredient be emit in large quantity by the vent spiracle small opening in the exoskeleton that allow insect to breathe hydrostatic skeleton endoskeleton power

or reversal symmetry be the theoretical symmetry of physical law under the transformation of time reversal imply the conservation of entropy since the second law of thermodynamics state that entropy increase a time flow toward the future in general the macroscopic universe do not show symmetry under time reversal in other word time be say to be or asymmetric except for special equilibrium state when the second law of thermodynamics predict the time symmetry to hold however quantum noninvasive measurement be predict to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium contrary to their classical counterpart although this have not yet be experimentally confirmed time asymmetry generally be cause by one of three category intrinsic to the dynamic physical law for the weak force due to the initial condition of our universe for the second law of thermodynamics due to measurement for the noninvasive measurement a toy call the illustrates in the two aspect of time reversal invariance when set into motion atop a pedestal rock side to side a in the image the figure oscillate for a very long time the toy be engineer to minimize friction and illustrate the reversibility of newton law of motion however the mechanically stable state of the toy be when the figure fall down from the pedestal into one of arbitrarily many position this be an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann identification of the logarithm of the number of state with the entropy physicists also discuss the invariance of local macroscopic description of physical system independent of the invariance of the underlying microscopic physical law for example maxwell equation with material absorption or newtonian mechanic with friction be not invariant at the macroscopic level where they be normally apply even if they be invariant at the microscopic level when one include the atomic motion the lose energy be translate into heat daily experience show that do not hold for the behavior of bulk material of these macroscopic law most notable be the second law of thermodynamics many other phenomenon such a the relative motion of body with friction or viscous motion of fluid reduce to this because the underlying mechanism be the dissipation of usable energy for example kinetic energy into heat the question of whether this dissipation be really inevitable have be consider by many physicist often in the context of maxwell demon the name come from a thought experiment describe by james clerk maxwell in which a microscopic demon guard a gate between two half of a room it only let slow molecule into one half only fast one into the other by eventually make one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter it seem to reduce the entropy of the room and reverse the arrow of time many analysis have be make of this all show that when the entropy of room and demon be take together this total entropy do increase modern analysis of this problem have take into account claude shannon relation between entropy and information many interesting result in modern computing be closely relate to this problem reversible compute quantum computing and physical limit to compute be examples these seemingly metaphysical question be today in these way slowly be convert into hypothesis of the physical science the current consensus hinge upon the identification of the logarithm of phase space volume with the negative of shannon information and hence to entropy in this notion a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system correspond to relatively low entropy because the coordinate of the molecule of the body be constrain a the system evolve in the presence of dissipation the molecular coordinate can move into large volume of phase space become more uncertain and thus lead to increase in entropy one can however equally well imagine a state of the universe in which the motion of all of the particle at one instant be the reverse strictly the cpt reverse such a state would then evolve in reverse so presumably entropy would decrease loschmidt paradox why be state prefer over the other one position be to say that the constant increase of entropy we observe happen only because of the initial state of our universe other possible state of the universe for example a universe at heat death equilibrium would actually result in no increase of entropy in this view the apparent of our universe be a problem in cosmology why do the universe start with a low entropy this view if it remain viable in the light of future cosmological observation would connect this problem to one of the big open question beyond the reach of today physics the question of initial condition of the universe an object can cross through the event horizon of a black hole from the outside and then fall rapidly to the central region where our understanding of physic break down since within a black hole the forward be direct towards the center and the backward be direct outward it be not even possible to define in the usual manner the only way anything can escape from a black hole be a hawk radiation the time reversal of a black hole would be a hypothetical object know a a white hole from the outside they appear similar while a black hole have a beginning and be inescapable a white hole have an end and can not be enter the forward of a white hole be direct outward and it backward be direct towards the center the event horizon of a black hole may be think of a a surface move outward at the local speed of light and be just on the edge between escape and fall back the event horizon of a white hole be a surface move inward at the local speed of light and be just on the edge between be sweep outward and succeed in reach the center they be two different kind of horizon of a white hole be like the horizon of a black hole turn the modern view of black hole irreversibility be to relate it to the second law of thermodynamics since black hole be view a thermodynamic object indeed accord to the duality conjecture all microscopic process in a black hole be reversible and only the collective behavior be irreversible a in any other macroscopic thermal system in physical and chemical kinetics of the mechanical microscopic equation imply two important law the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relation of the microscopic description together with it kinetic consequence be call microscopic reversibility classical variable that do not change upon time reversal include position of a particle in acceleration of the particle force on the particle energy of the particle electric potential voltage electric field electric displacement density of electric charge electric polarization energy density of the electromagnetic field maxwell stress tensor all mass charge couple constant and other physical constant except those associate with the weak force classical variable that time reversal negates include the time when an event occur velocity of a particle linear momentum of a particle angular momentum of a particle both orbital and spin electromagnetic vector potential magnetic field magnetic auxiliary field density of electric current magnetization poynting vector power rate of work do most system be asymmetric under time reversal but there may be phenomena with symmetry in classical mechanic a velocity v reverse under the operation of t but an acceleration do not therefore one model dissipative phenomenon through term that be odd in v however delicate experiment in which known source of dissipation be remove reveal that the law of mechanic be time reversal invariant dissipation itself be originate in the second law of thermodynamics the motion of a charge body in a magnetic field b involve the velocity through the lorentz force term v b and might seem at first to be asymmetric under t a close look assure u that b also change sign under time reversal this happen because a magnetic field be produce by an electric current j which reverse sign under t thus the motion of classical charge particle in electromagnetic field be also time reversal invariant despite this it be still useful to consider the in a local sense when the external field be hold fixed a when the effect be analyze this allow one to analyze the condition under which optical phenomenon that locally break such a faraday isolators and directional dichroism can occur the law of gravity also seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanic in physic one separate the law of motion call kinematics from the law of force call dynamic follow the classical kinematics of newton law of motion the kinematics of quantum mechanic be build in such a way that it presuppose nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamic in other word if the dynamic be invariant then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant if the dynamic be not then the kinematics will also show this the structure of the quantum law of motion be rich and we examine these next reversal in quantum parity be give by a pair of quantum state that go into each other under parity however this representation can always be reduce to linear combination of state each of which be either even or odd under parity one say that all irreducible representation of parity be kramers theorem state that time reversal need not have this property because it be represent by an operator this section contain a discussion of the three most important property of time reversal in quantum mechanic chiefly that it must be represent a an operator that it protect quantum state from have an electric dipole moment that it have representation with the property for fermion the strangeness of this result be clear if one compare it with parity if parity transform a pair of quantum state into each other then the sum and difference of these two basis state be state of good parity time reversal do not behave like this it seem to violate the theorem that all abelian group be represent by irreducible representation the reason it do this be that it be represent by an operator it thus open the way to spinors in quantum mechanic on the other hand the notion of time reversal turn out to be a useful tool for the development of physically motivate quantum compute and simulation setting provide at the same time relatively simple tool to assess their complexity for instance time reversal be use to develop novel boson sample scheme and to prove the duality between two fundamental optical operation beam splitter and squeeze transformation representation of time eugene wigner show that a symmetry operation s of a hamiltonian be represent in quantum mechanic either by a unitary operator or an antiunitary one where u be unitary and k denotes complex conjugation these be the only operation that act on hilbert space so a to preserve the length of the projection of any one onto another consider the parity operator act on the position it reverse the direction of space so that similarly it reverse the direction of momentum so that where x and p be the position and momentum operator this preserve the canonical commutator where ħ be the reduced planck constant only if p be choose to be unitary on the other hand the time reversal operator t it do nothing to the but it reverse the direction of p so that the canonical commutator be invariant only if t be choose to be another argument involve energy the of the if time reversal be implement a a unitary operator it would reverse the sign of the energy just a revers the sign of the momentum this be not possible because unlike momentum energy be always positive since energy in quantum mechanic be define a the phase factor exp iet that one get when one move forward in time the way to reverse time while preserve the sign of the energy be to also reverse the sense of so that the sense of phase be reverse similarly any operation that reverse the sense of phase which change the sign of i will turn positive energy into negative energy unless it also change the direction of time so every antiunitary symmetry in a theory with positive energy must reverse the direction of time every antiunitary operator can be write a the product of the time reversal operator and a unitary operator that do not reverse time for a particle with spin j one can use the representation where j be the y of the spin and use of have be make dipole this have an interesting consequence on the electric dipole moment edm of any particle the edm be define through the shift in the energy of a state when it be put in an external electric field where d be call the edm and δ the induced dipole moment one important property of an edm be that the energy shift due to it change sign under a parity transformation however since be a vector it expectation value in a state must be proportional to j that be the expected spin thus under time reversal an invariant state must have vanish edm in other word a edm signal both p and t some molecule such a water must have edm irrespective of whether be a symmetry this be correct if a quantum system have degenerate ground state that transform into each other under parity then time reversal need not be break to give edm experimentally observe bound on the electric dipole moment of the nucleon currently set stringent limit on the violation of time reversal symmetry in the strong interaction and their modern theory quantum chromodynamics then use the cpt invariance of a relativistic quantum field theory this put strong bound on strong cp violation experimental bound on the electron electric dipole moment also place limit on theory of particle physic and their parameter for t which be an z symmetry generator t ukuk uu u u t φ where φ be a diagonal matrix of phase a a result and showing that φ u φ this mean that the entry in φ be a a result of which one may have either this be specific to the of t for a unitary operator such a the parity any phase be allow next take a hamiltonian invariant under t let a and t a be two quantum state of the same energy now if then one find that the state be orthogonal a result call theorem this imply that if then there be a twofold degeneracy in the state this result in quantum mechanic presage the spin statistic theorem of quantum field theory quantum state that give unitary representation of time reversal have be characterize by a multiplicative quantum number sometimes call the time reversal transformation for fermion in quantum field theory can be represent by an spinor in which the can be a complex number with unit radius the cpt invariance be not a theorem but a property in these class of theory reversal of the known dynamical particle physic codify the basic law of dynamic into the standard model this be formulate a a quantum field theory that have cpt symmetry the law be invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal parity and charge conjugation however time reversal itself be see not to be a symmetry this be usually call cp violation there be two possible origin of this asymmetry one through the mixing of different flavour of quark in their weak decay the second through a direct cp violation in strong interaction the first be see in experiment the second be strongly constrain by the of the edm of a neutron time reversal violation be unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry the effect of time reversal be to rename particle a antiparticle and vice versa thus the second law of thermodynamics be think to originate in the initial condition in the universe reversal of noninvasive strong measurement both classical and quantum be certainly disturb cause asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics however noninvasive measurement should not disturb the evolution so they be expect to be surprisingly it be true only in classical physic but not quantum even in a thermodynamically invariant equilibrium state this type of asymmetry be independent of cpt symmetry but have not yet be confirm experimentally due to extreme condition of the checking proposal the second law of thermodynamics

gene expression be the process by which information from a gene be use in the synthesis of a functional gene product these product be often protein but in gene such a transfer rna trna or small nuclear rna snrna gene the product be a functional rna gene expression be summarize in the central dogma first formulate by francis crick in further developed in his article and expand by the subsequent discovery of reverse transcription and rna replication the process of gene expression be use by all know include multicellular organism prokaryotes bacteria and archaea and utilized by generate the macromolecular machinery for life in genetics gene expression be the most fundamental level at which the genotype give rise to the phenotype observable trait the genetic information store in dna represent the genotype whereas the phenotype result from the interpretation of that information such phenotype be often express by the synthesis of protein that control the organism structure and development or that act a enzyme catalyze specific metabolic pathway all step in the gene expression process may be modulate regulated include the transcription rna splice translation and modification of a protein regulation of gene expression give control over the timing location and amount of a give gene product protein or ncrna present in a cell and can have a profound effect on the cellular structure and function regulation of gene expression be the basis for cellular differentiation development morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism gene regulation may also serve a a substrate for evolutionary change the process of transcription be carry out by rna polymerase rnap which use dna black a a template and produce rna blue the production of a rna copy from a dna strand be call transcription and be perform by rna polymerase which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a grow rna strand a per the complementarity law of the nucleotide base this rna be complementary to the template dna strand with the exception that thymine t be replace with uracils u in the rna in prokaryote transcription be carry out by a single type of rna polymerase which need to bind a dna sequence call a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein σ factor to start transcription in eukaryote transcription be perform in the nucleus by three type of rna polymerase each of which need a special dna sequence call the promoter and a set of initiate the process see regulation of transcription below rna polymerase i be responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna rrna gene rna polymerase ii pol ii transcribes all gene but also some rna snrnas snornas or long rna rna polymerase iii transcribes rrna transfer rna trna gene and some small rna transcription end when the polymerase encounter a sequence call the terminator while transcription of prokaryotic gene creates messenger rna mrna that be ready for translation into protein transcription of eukaryotic gene leave a primary transcript of rna which first have to undergo a series of modification to become a mature rna type and step involve in the maturation process vary between cod and prernas even though prerna molecule for both mrna and trna undergo splice the step and machinery involve be different the processing of rna be describe below rna maturation the processing of premrna include cap which be set of enzymatic reaction that add to the end of and thus protect the rna from degradation by exonucleases the cap be then bind by cap binding complex heterodimer which aid in mrna export to cytoplasm and also protect the rna from decapping another modification be cleavage and polyadenylation they occur if polyadenylation signal sequence be present in which be usually between sequence and terminator the be first cleave and then a series of adenine a be add to form poly a tail which protect the rna from degradation the poly a tail be bind by multiple poly a protein pabps necessary for mrna export and translation in the inverse process of deadenylation poly a tail be shorten by the exonuclease which often lead to full transcript decay illustration of exon and intron in and the formation of mature mrna by splice the utrs in green be part of exon at the end of the mrna a very important modification of eukaryotic be rna splice the majority of eukaryotic consist of alternate segment call exon and intron during the process of splice an catalytical complex know a spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reaction which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure and then splice neighbour exon together in certain case some intron or exon can be either remove or retain in mature mrna this alternative splicing create series of different transcript originate from a single gene because these transcript can be potentially translate into different protein splice extend the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a specie proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolutionary advantage make possible by the nucleus of eukaryote in prokaryote transcription and translation happen together whilst in eukaryotes the nuclear membrane separate the two process give time for rna processing to occur rna in most organisms gene ncrna be transcribe a precursor that undergo further processing in the case of ribosomal rna rrna they be often transcribe a a that contain one or more rrnas the be cleave and modify and pseudouridine formation at specific site by approximately different small rna specie call snornas snornas associate with protein form snornps while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site the protein part perform the catalytical reaction in eukaryote in particular a snornp call rnase mrp cleave the into the and rrnas the rrna and rna processing factor form large aggregate call the nucleolus in the case of transfer rna trna for example the sequence be remove by rnase p whereas the end be remove by the trnase z enzyme and the cca tail be add by a nucleotidyl transferase in the case of micro rna mirna mirnas be first transcribe a primary transcript or with a cap and tail and process to short structure know a in the cell nucleus by the enzyme drosha and pasha after be export it be then process to mature mirnas in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease dicer which also initiate the formation of the silencing complex risc compose of the argonaute protein even snrnas and snornas themselves undergo series of modification before they become part of functional rnp complex this be do either in the nucleoplasm or in the specialized compartment call cajal body their base be methylated or pseudouridinilated by a group of small cajal rnas scarnas which be structurally similar to snornas in eukaryote most mature rna must be export to the cytoplasm from the nucleus while some rna function in the nucleus many rna be transport through the nuclear pore and into the cytosol export of rnas require association with specific protein know a exportins specific exportin molecule be responsible for the export of a give rna type mrna transport also require the correct association with exon junction complex ejc which ensure that correct processing of the mrna be complete before export in some case rna be additionally transport to a specific part of the cytoplasm such a a synapse they be then tow by motor protein that bind through linker protein to specific sequence call zipcodes on the rna for some rna rna the mature rna be the final gene product in the case of messenger rna mrna the rna be an information carrier cod for the synthesis of one or more protein mrna carry a single protein sequence common in eukaryote be monocistronic whilst mrna carry multiple protein sequence common in prokaryote be know a the translation trna charge with amino acid enter the ribosome and aligns with the correct mrna triplet ribosome then add amino acid to grow protein mrna consists of three part a untranslated region a region or open reading frame orf and a untranslated region the coding region carry information for protein synthesis encode by the genetic code to form triplet each triplet of nucleotide of the cod region be call a codon and correspond to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer rna transfer rna with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid amino acid be then chain together by the ribosome accord to the order of triplet in the coding region the ribosome help transfer rna to bind to messenger rna and take the amino acid from each transfer rna and make a protein out of it each mrna molecule be translate into many protein molecule on average in mammal in prokaryote translation generally occur at the point of transcription often use a messenger rna that be still in the process of be create in eukaryote translation can occur in a variety of region of the cell depend on where the protein be write be suppose to be major location be the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic protein and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for protein that be for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane protein that be suppose to be express at the endoplasmic reticulum be recognise through the translation process this be govern by the signal recognition protein that bind to the ribosome and direct it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it find a signal peptide on the grow nascent amino acid chain protein before left and after right fold each protein exist a an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translate from a sequence of mrna into a linear chain of amino acid this polypeptide lack any developed structure the left hand side of the neighboring figure the polypeptide then fold into it characteristic and functional structure from a random coil amino acid interact with each other to produce a structure the fold protein the right hand side of the figure know a the native state the resulting structure be determine by the amino acid sequence anfinsen dogma the correct structure be essential to function although some part of functional protein may remain unfolded failure to fold into the intended shape usually produce inactive protein with different property include toxic prion several neurodegenerative and other disease be believe to result from the accumulation of misfolded protein many allergy be cause by the folding of the protein for the immune system do not produce antibody for certain protein structure enzymes call chaperone assist the newly form protein to attain fold into the structure it need to function similarly rna chaperone help rnas attain their functional shape assist protein folding be one of the main role of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryote secretory protein of eukaryote or prokaryote must be translocate to enter the secretory pathway newly synthesize protein be direct to the eukaryotic or prokaryotic secyeg translocation channel by signal peptide the efficiency of protein secretion in eukaryote be very dependent on the signal peptide which have be use many protein be destine for other part of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signal sequence or signal peptide be use to direct protein to where they be suppose to be in prokaryote this be normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell however in eukaryote there be a great variety of different target process to ensure the protein arrive at the correct organelle not all protein remain within the cell and many be export for example digestive enzyme hormone and extracellular matrix protein in eukaryotes the export pathway be well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these protein be translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum follow by transport via the golgi apparatus the patchy colour of a tortoiseshell cat be the result of different level of expression of pigmentation gene in different area of the skin regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene control of expression be vital to allow a cell to produce the gene product it need when it need them in turn this give cell the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment external signal damage to the cell and other stimulus more generally gene regulation give the cell control over all structure and function and be the basis for cellular differentiation morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism numerous term be use to describe type of gene depend on how they be regulate these include a gene be a gene that be transcribe continually a oppose to a facultative gene which be only transcribed when need a housekeeping gene be a gene that be require to maintain basic cellular function and so be typically express in all cell type of an organism examples include actin gapdh and ubiquitin some housekeeping gene be transcribe at a relatively constant rate and these gene can be use a a reference point in experiment to measure the expression rate of other gene a gene be a gene only transcribe when need a oppose to a constitutive gene an gene be a gene whose expression be either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle any step of gene expression may be modulate from the transcription step to modification of a protein the stability of the final gene product whether it be rna or protein also contribute to the expression level of the unstable product result in a low expression level in general gene expression be regulate through change in the number and type of interaction between molecule that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna some simple example of where gene expression be important be control of insulin expression so it give a signal for blood glucose regulation x chromosome inactivation in female mammal to prevent an overdose of the gene it contain cyclin expression level control progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle when lactose be present in a prokaryote it act a an inducer and inactivate the repressor so that the gene for lactose metabolism can be transcribe regulation of transcription can be break down into three main route of influence genetic direct interaction of a control factor with the gene modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic change in dna structure that influence transcription lambda repressor transcription factor green bind a a dimer to major groove of dna target red and blue and disable initiation of transcription from direct interaction with dna be the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein change transcription level gene often have several protein bind site around the cod region with the specific function of regulate transcription there be many class of regulatory dna binding sit know a enhancer insulator and silencer the mechanism for regulate transcription be very varied from block key bind site on the dna for rna polymerase to act a an activator and promote transcription by assist rna polymerase bind the activity of transcription factor be far modulate by intracellular signal cause protein modification include phosphorylated acetylate or glycosylated these change influence a transcription factor ability to bind directly or indirectly to promoter dna to recruit rna polymerase or to favor elongation of a newly synthesize rna molecule the nuclear membrane in eukaryote allow further regulation of transcription factor by the duration of their presence in the nucleus which be regulate by reversible change in their structure and by binding of other protein environmental stimulus or endocrine signal may cause modification of regulatory protein elicit cascade of intracellular signal which result in regulation of gene expression more recently it have become apparent that there be a significant influence of specific effect on transcription these effect be refer to a epigenetic and involve the high order structure of dna specific dna binding protein and chemical modification of dna in general epigenetic effect alter the accessibility of dna to protein and so modulate transcription in eukaryote dna be organize in form of nucleosomes note how the dna blue and green be tightly wrap around the protein core make of histone octamer ribbon coil restrict access to the dna from dna methylation be a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and be see in bacteria and eukaryote and have role in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation in eukaryotes the structure of chromatin control by the histone code regulate access to dna with significant impact on the expression of gene in euchromatin and heterochromatin area regulation in the majority of gene promoter contain a cpg island with numerous cpg site when many of a gene promoter cpg site be methylated the gene become silenced colorectal cancer typically have to driver mutation and to hitchhiker or passenger mutation however transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in cause progression to cancer for example in colorectal cancer about to gene be transcriptionally silence by cpg island methylation see regulation of transcription in cancer transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanism such a altered expression of micrornas in breast cancer transcriptional repression of may occur more frequently by than by hypermethylation of the promoter see low expression of in breast and ovarian cancer in eukaryote where export of rna be require before translation be possible nuclear export be think to provide additional control over gene expression all transport in and out of the nucleus be via the nuclear pore and transport be control by a wide range of importin and exportin protein expression of a gene cod for a protein be only possible if the messenger rna carry the code survive long enough to be translate in a typical cell an rna molecule be only stable if specifically protect from degradation rna degradation have particular importance in regulation of expression in eukaryotic cell where mrna have to travel significant distance before be translate in eukaryote rna be stabilise by certain modification particularly the cap and tail intentional degradation of mrna be use not just a a defence mechanism from foreign rna normally from virus but also a a route of mrna destabilisation if an mrna molecule have a complementary sequence to a small interfering rna then it be target for destruction via the rna interference pathway prime untranslated region and three prime untranslated region of messenger rna mrnas often contain regulatory sequence that influence gene expression such often contain both bind site for micrornas mirnas as well a for regulatory protein by bind to specific site within the mirnas can decrease gene expression of various mrna by either inhibit translation or directly cause degradation of the transcript the also may have silencer region that bind repressor protein that inhibit the expression of a mrna the often contain microrna response element mres mres be sequence to which mirnas bind these be prevalent motif within among all regulatory motif within the include silencer region mres make up about half of the motif a of the mirbase web site an archive of mirna sequence and annotation list entry in biologic specie of these mirnas be in annotated human mirna locus mirnas be predict to have an average of about four hundred target mrna affect expression of several hundred gene friedman et al estimate that mirna target site within human mrna be conserve above background level and of human gene have be under selective pressure to maintain pair to mirnas direct experiment show that a single mirna can reduce the stability of hundred of unique mrna other experiment show that a single mirna may repress the production of hundred of protein but that this repression often be relatively mild less than the effect of mirna dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer for instance in gastrointestinal cancer nine mirnas have be identify a epigenetically alter and effective in down regulate dna repair enzymes the effect of mirna dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorder such a schizophrenia bipolar disorder major depression parkinson disease alzheimer disease and autism spectrum disorder neomycin be an example of a small molecule that reduce expression of all protein gene inevitably lead to cell death it thus act a an antibiotic direct regulation of translation be less prevalent than control of transcription or mrna stability but be occasionally used inhibition of protein translation be a major target for toxin and antibiotic so they can kill a cell by override it normal gene expression control protein synthesis inhibitor include the antibiotic neomycin and the toxin ricin modification ptms be covalent modification to protein like rna splice they help to significantly diversify the proteome these modification be usually catalyze by enzyme additionally process like covalent addition to amino acid side chain residue can often be reverse by other enzyme however some like the proteolytic cleavage of the protein backbone be irreversible ptms play many important role in the cell for example phosphorylation be primarily involve in activate and deactivate protein and in signal pathway ptms be involve in transcriptional regulation an important function of acetylation and methylation be histone tail modification which alter how accessible dna be for transcription they can also be see in the immune system where glycosylation play a key role one type of ptm can initiate another type of ptm a can be see in how ubiquitination tag protein for degradation through proteolysis proteolysis other than be involve in break down protein be also important in activate and deactivate them and in regulate biological process such a dna transcription and cell death measure gene expression be an important part of many life science a the ability to quantify the level at which a particular gene be express within a cell tissue or organism can provide a lot of valuable information for example measure gene expression can viral infection of a cell viral protein expression an individual susceptibility to cancer oncogene expression if a bacterium be resistant to penicillin expression similarly the analysis of the location of protein expression be a powerful tool and this can be do on an organismal or cellular scale investigation of localization be particularly important for the study of development in multicellular organism and a an indicator of protein function in single cell ideally measurement of expression be do by detect the final gene product for many gene this be the protein however it be often easy to detect one of the precursor typically mrna and to infer level from these measurement level of mrna can be quantitatively measure by northern blot which provide size and sequence information about the mrna molecules a sample of rna be separate on an agarose gel and hybridize to a radioactively label rna probe that be complementary to the target sequence the radiolabeled rna be then detect by an autoradiograph because the use of radioactive reagent make the procedure time consume and potentially dangerous alternative labeling and detection method such a digoxigenin and biotin chemistry have be develop perceived disadvantage of northern blotting be that large quantity of rna be require and that quantification may not be completely accurate a it involve measure band strength in an image of a gel on the other hand the additional mrna size information from the northern blot allow the discrimination of alternately splice transcript another approach for measure mrna abundance be in this technique reverse transcription be follow by quantitative pcr reverse transcription first generate a dna template from the mrna this template be call cdna the cdna template be then amplify in the quantitative step during which the fluorescence emit by labeled hybridization probe or intercalate dye change a the dna amplification process progress with a carefully construct standard curve qpcr can produce an absolute measurement of the number of copy of original mrna typically in unit of copy per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copy per cell qpcr be very sensitive detection of a single mrna molecule be theoretically possible but can be expensive depend on the type of reporter use fluorescently label oligonucleotide probe be more expensive than intercalate fluorescent dye for expression profiling or analysis of many gene within a sample quantitative pcr may be perform for hundred of gene simultaneously in the case of array a second approach be the hybridization microarray a single array or chip may contain probe to determine transcript level for every know gene in the genome of one or more organism alternatively tag base technology like serial analysis of gene expression sage and which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mrna can be use an advantage of method be the open architecture allow for the exact measurement of any transcript with a know or unknown sequence sequence ng such a be another approach produce vast quantity of sequence data that can be match to a reference genome although ng be comparatively expensive and it can identify polymorphism and novel gene and can also be use to profile expression in organism for which little or no sequence information be available profile in wikipedia the rna expression profile of the transporter one of the main glucose transporter find in the human body profile like these be find for almost all protein list in wikipedia they be generate by organization such a the genomics institute of the novartis research foundation and the european bioinformatics institute additional information can be find by search their database for an example of the transporter picture here see citation these profile indicate the level of dna expression and hence rna produce of a certain protein in a certain tissue and be accordingly in the image locate in the protein box on the right side of each wikipedia page for gene encode proteins the expression level can be directly assess by a number of method with some clear analogy to the technique for mrna quantification the most commonly used method be to perform a western blot against the protein of give information on the size of the protein in addition to it identity a sample often cellular lysate be separate on a polyacrylamide gel transfer to a membrane and then probe with an antibody to the protein of interest the antibody can either be conjugate to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for image quantification the nature of this assay make quantification less accurate but it have the advantage of be able to identify late modification to the protein for example proteolysis or ubiquitination from change in size quantification of protein and mrna permit a correlation of the two level the question of how well protein level correlate with their corresponding transcript level be highly debate and depend on multiple factor regulation on each step of gene expression can impact the correlation a show for regulation of translation or protein stability factor such a protein transport in highly polar cell can influence the measured correlation as well in of drosophila embryo at different developmental stage for the mrna responsible for the expression of hunchback high intensity of blue color mark place with high hunchback mrna quantity analysis of expression be not limit to quantification localisation can also be determine mrna can be detect with a suitably label complementary mrna strand and protein can be detect via labelled antibody the probed sample be then observe by microscopy to identify where the mrna or protein be the structure of green fluorescent protein the residue in the centre of the barrel be responsible for production of green light after expose to high energetic blue light from by replace the gene with a new version fuse to a green fluorescent protein or similar marker expression may be directly quantify in live cell this be do by image use a fluorescence microscope it be very difficult to clone a protein into it native location in the genome without affect expression level so this method often can not be use to measure endogenous gene expression it be however widely use to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduce into the cell for example via an expression vector it be important to note that by fuse a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein behavior include it cellular localization and expression level can be significantly change the immunosorbent assay work by use antibody immobilise on a microtiter plate to capture protein of interest from sample add to the well use a detection antibody conjugate to an enzyme or fluorophore the quantity of bound protein can be accurately measure by fluorometric or colourimetric detection the detection process be very similar to that of a western blot but by avoid the gel step more accurate quantification can be achieve inducible shrna system an expression system be a system specifically design for the production of a gene product of choice this be normally a protein although may also be rna such a trna or a ribozyme an expression system consist of a gene normally encode by dna and the molecular machinery require to transcribe the dna into mrna and translate the mrna into protein use the reagent provide in the broad sense this include every living cell but the term be more normally use to refer to expression a a laboratory tool an expression system be therefore often artificial in some manner expression system be however a fundamentally natural process virus be an excellent example where they replicate by use the host cell a an expression system for the viral protein and genome doxycycline be also use in and tetracycline control transcriptional activation to regulate transgene expression in organism and cell culture in addition to these biological tool certain naturally observed configuration of dna gene promoter enhancer repressor and the associated machinery itself be refer to a an expression system this term be normally use in the case where a gene or set of gene be switch on under well define condition for example the simple repressor switch expression system in lambda phage and the lac operator system in bacteria several natural expression system be directly use or modify and use for artificial expression system such a the and expression system gene have sometimes be regard a node in a network with input be protein such a transcription factor and output be the level of gene expression the node itself perform a function and the operation of these function have be interpret a perform a kind of information processing within cell and determines cellular behavior gene network can also be construct without formulate an explicit causal model this be often the case when assemble network from large expression data set covariation and correlation of expression be compute across a large sample of case and measurement often transcriptome or proteome data the source of variation can be either experimental or natural observational there be several way to construct gene expression network but one common approach be to compute a matrix of all correlation of expression across condition time point or individual and convert the matrix after thresholding at some value into a graphical representation in which node represent gene transcript or protein and edge connect these node represent the strength of association see the following

central dogma depict transcription from dna code to rna code to the protein in the second step cover the production of protein protein production be the biotechnological process of generate a specific protein it be typically achieve by the manipulation of gene expression in an organism such that it express large amount of a recombinant gene this include the transcription of the recombinant dna to messenger rna mrna the translation of mrna into polypeptide chain which be ultimately fold into functional protein and may be target to specific subcellular or extracellular location protein production system in lab jargon also refer to a system be use in the life science biotechnology and medicine molecular biology research use numerous protein and enzymes many of which be from expression system particularly dna polymerase for pcr reverse transcriptase for rna analysis restriction endonucleases for clone and to make protein that be screen in drug discovery a biological target or a potential drug themselves there be also significant application for expression system in industrial fermentation notably the production of biopharmaceuticals such a human insulin to treat diabetes and to manufacture enzyme commonly use protein production system include those derive from bacteria yeast mammalian cell and more recently filamentous fungi such a myceliophthora thermophila when biopharmaceuticals be produce with one of these system impurity term host cell protein also arrive in the final product in trace amount the old and most widely used expression system be and may be define a the of an expression vector it clone dna and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell that be produce protein at a high level overexpression be an abnormally and excessively high level of gene expression which produce a pronounced phenotype there be many way to introduce foreign dna to a cell for expression and many different host cell may be use for expression each expression system have distinct advantage and liability expression system be normally refer to by the host and the dna source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material for example common host be bacteria such a b subtilis yeast such a or eukaryotic cell line common dna source and delivery mechanism be virus such a baculovirus retrovirus adenovirus plasmid artificial chromosome and bacteriophage such a lambda the best expression system depend on the gene involve for example the saccharomyces cerevisiae be often prefer for protein that require significant posttranslational modification insect or mammal cell line be use when splice of mrna be require nonetheless bacterial expression have the advantage of easily produce large amount of protein which be require for crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance experiment for structure determination because bacteria be prokaryotes they be not equip with the full enzymatic machinery to accomplish the required modification or molecular folding hence eukaryotic protein express in bacteria often be also many protein become insoluble a inclusion body that be difficult to recover without harsh denaturant and subsequent cumbersome to address these concern expression system use multiple eukaryotic cell be develop for application require the protein be conform a in or close to eukaryotic organism cell of plant tobacco of insect or mammalian bovine be transfected with gene and culture in suspension and even a tissue or whole organism to produce fully

epigenetic feature of plant insect and mammalian system other protein production system be develop use unicellular eukaryote cell bacterial system escherichia coli coli one of the most popular host for artificial gene expression coli be one of the most widely use expression host and dna be normally introduce in a plasmid expression vector the technique for overexpression in e coli be well developed and work by increase the number of copy of the gene or increase the binding strength of the promoter region so assist transcription for example a dna sequence for a protein of interest could be clone or subcloned into a high plasmid contain the lac often promoter which be then transform into the bacterium e coli addition of iptg a lactose analog activate the lac promoter and cause the bacteria to express the protein of interest coli strain and be two strain commonly use for protein production a member of the b lineage they lack lon and ompt protease protect the produced protein

simplify diagram of mrna synthesis and processing enzyme not show transcription be the first of several step of dna base gene expression in which a particular segment of dna be copy into rna especially mrna by the enzyme rna polymerase both dna and rna be nucleic acid which use base pair of nucleotide a a complementary language during transcription a dna sequence be read by an rna polymerase which produce a complementary antiparallel rna strand call a primary transcript transcription proceeds in the following general step rna polymerase together with one or more general transcription factor bind to promoter dna rna polymerase generate a transcription bubble which separate the two strand of the dna helix this be do by break the hydrogen bond between complementary dna nucleotide rna polymerase add rna nucleotide which be complementary to the nucleotide of one dna strand rna backbone form with assistance from rna polymerase to form an rna strand hydrogen bond of the helix break free the newly synthesize rna strand if the cell have a nucleus the rna may be far process this may include polyadenylation cap and splice the rna may remain in the nucleus or exit to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex the stretch of dna transcribe into an rna molecule be call a transcription unit and encodes at least one gene if the gene encode a protein the transcription produce messenger rna mrna the mrna in turn serf a a template for the protein synthesis through translation alternatively the transcribed gene may encode for rna such a microrna ribosomal rna rrna transfer rna trna or enzymatic rna molecule call ribozymes overall rna help synthesize regulate and process protein it therefore play a fundamental role in perform function within a cell in virology the term may also be use when refer to mrna synthesis from an rna molecule rna replication for instance the genome of a rna ssrna virus may be template for a rna ssrna this be because the strand contain the information need to translate the viral protein for viral replication afterwards this process be catalyze by a viral rna replicase a dna transcription unit encode for a protein may contain both a coding sequence which will be translate into the protein and regulatory sequence which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein the regulatory sequence before upstream from the cod sequence be call the five prime untranslated region the sequence after downstream from the cod sequence be call the three prime untranslated region a oppose to dna replication transcription result in an rna complement that include the nucleotide uracil u in all instance where thymine t would have occur in a dna complement only one of the two dna strand serve a a template for transcription the antisense strand of dna be read by rna polymerase from the end to the end during transcription the complementary rna be create in the opposite direction in the direction match the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switch uracil for thymine this directionality be because rna polymerase can only add nucleotide to the end of the grow mrna chain this use of only the dna strand eliminate the need for the okazaki fragment that be see in dna replication this also remove the need for an rna primer to initiate rna synthesis a be the case in dna replication the non sense strand of dna be call the coding strand because it sequence be the same a the newly create rna transcript except for the substitution of uracil for thymine this be the strand that be use by convention when present a dna sequence transcription have some proofread mechanism but they be few and less effective than the control for copy dna a a result transcription have a low copying fidelity than dna replication transcription be divide into initiation promoter escape elongation and termination initiation transcription begin with the binding of rna polymerase together with one or more general transcription factor to a specific dna sequence refer to a a promoter to form an rna close complex in the closed complex the promoter dna be still fully rna polymerase assist by one or more general transcription factor then unwind approximately base pair of dna to form an rna open complex in the open complex the promoter dna be partly unwound and the exposed dna be refer to a the transcription bubble rna polymerase assist by one or more general transcription factor then select a start site in the transcription bubble bind to an initiating ntp and an extend ntp or a short rna primer and an extend ntp complementary to the transcription start site sequence and catalyze bond formation to yield an initial rna product in bacteria rna polymerase holoenzyme consist of five subunit α subunit β subunit β subunit and ω subunit in bacteria there be one general rna transcription factor know a a sigma factor rna polymerase core enzyme bind to the bacterial general transcription sigma factor to form rna polymerase holoenzyme and then bind to a promoter rna polymerase be call a holoenzyme when sigma subunit be attach to the core enzyme which be consist of α subunit β subunit β subunit only in archaea and eukaryotes rna polymerase contain subunit homologous to each of the five rna polymerase subunit in bacteria and also contain additional subunit in archaea and eukaryotes the function of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma be perform by multiple general transcription factor that work together in archaea there be three general transcription factor tbp tfb and tfe in eukaryote in rna polymerase transcription there be six general transcription factor tfiia tfiib an ortholog of archaeal tfb tfiid a multisubunit factor in which the key subunit tbp be an ortholog of archaeal tbp tfiie an ortholog of archaeal tfe tfiif and tfiih the tfiid be the first component to bind to dna due to bind of tbp while tfiih be the last component to be recruit in archaea and eukaryotes the rna close complex be usually refer to a the preinitiation complex transcription initiation be regulate by additional protein know a activator and repressor and in some case associate coactivators or corepressors which modulate formation and function of the transcription initiation complex promoter escape after the first bond be synthesize the rna polymerase must escape the promoter during this time there be a tendency to release the rna transcript and produce truncate transcript this be call abortive initiation and be common for both eukaryote and prokaryote abortive initiation continue to occur until an rna product of a threshold length of approximately nucleotide be synthesize at which point promoter escape occur and a transcription elongation complex be form mechanistically promoter escape occur through dna scrunch provide the energy need to break interaction between rna polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter in bacteria it be historically think that the sigma factor be definitely release after promoter clearance occur this theory have be know a the obligate release model however later data show that upon and follow promoter clearance the sigma factor be release accord to a stochastic model know a the stochastic release model in eukaryote at an rna polymerase promoter upon promoter clearance tfiih phosphorylates serine on the carboxy terminal domain of rna polymerase ii lead to the recruitment of cap enzyme ce the exact mechanism of how ce induces promoter clearance in eukaryote be not yet know elongation simple diagram of transcription elongation one strand of the dna the template strand or noncoding strand be use a a template for rna synthesis a transcription proceeds rna polymerase traverse the template strand and use base pair complementarity with the dna template to create an rna copy which elongate during the traversal although rna polymerase traverse the template strand from the cod strand and newly form rna can also be use a reference point so transcription can be describe a occur this produce an rna molecule from an exact copy of the coding strand except that thymine be replace with uracil and the nucleotide be compose of a ribose sugar where dna have deoxyribose one few oxygen atom in it backbone mrna transcription can involve multiple rna polymerase on a single dna template and multiple round of transcription amplification of particular mrna so many mrna molecule can be rapidly produce from a single copy of a gene the characteristic elongation rate in prokaryote and eukaryote be about in eukaryote however nucleosomes act a major barrier to transcribe polymerase during transcription elongation in these organism the pausing induce by nucleosomes can be regulate by transcription elongation factor such a tfiis elongation also involve a proofreading mechanism that can replace incorrectly incorporate base in eukaryote this may correspond with short pause during transcription that allow appropriate rna edit factor to bind these pause may be intrinsic to the rna polymerase or due to chromatin structure termination bacteria use two different strategy for transcription termination termination and termination in transcription termination rna transcription stop when the newly synthesize rna molecule form a hairpin loop follow by a run of u when the hairpin form the mechanical stress break the weak bond now fill the hybrid this pull the transcript out of the active site of the rna polymerase terminate transcription in the type of termination a protein factor call rho destabilize the interaction between the template and the mrna thus release the newly synthesize mrna from the elongation complex transcription termination in eukaryote be less well understood than in bacteria but involve cleavage of the new transcript follow by addition of adenine at it new end in a process call polyadenylation transcription inhibitor can be use a antibiotic against for example pathogenic bacteria antibacterial and fungi antifungal an example of such an antibacterial be rifampicin which inhibit bacterial transcription of dna into mrna by inhibit rna polymerase by bind it while be an antifungal transcription inhibitor the effect of histone methylation may also work to inhibit the action of transcription in vertebrates the majority of gene promoter contain a cpg island with numerous cpg site when many of a gene promoter cpg site be methylated the gene become inhibit silenced colorectal cancer typically have to driver mutation and to hitchhiker or passenger mutation however transcriptional inhibition silencing may be of more importance than mutation in cause progression to cancer for example in colorectal cancer about to gene be transcriptionally inhibit by cpg island methylation see regulation of transcription in cancer transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanism such a altered expression of micrornas in breast cancer transcriptional repression of may occur more frequently by than by hypermethylation of the promoter see low expression of in breast and ovarian cancer active transcription unit be cluster in the nucleus in discrete site call transcription factory or euchromatin such site can be visualize by allow engage polymerase to extend their transcript in tagged precursor or and the tagged nascent rna transcription factory can also be localize use fluorescence in situ hybridization or mark by antibody direct against polymerase there be factory in the nucleoplasm of a hela cell among which be polymerase ii factory and polymerase iii factory each polymerase ii factory contains polymerases a most active transcription unit be associate with only one polymerase each factory usually contain different transcription unit these unit might be associate through promoter enhancer with loop form a cloud around the factor a molecule that allow the genetic material to be realize a a protein be first hypothesize by françois jacob and jacques monod severo ochoa win a nobel prize in physiology or medicine in for develop a process for synthesize rna in vitro with polynucleotide phosphorylase which be useful for crack the genetic code rna synthesis by rna polymerase be establish in vitro by several laboratory by however the rna synthesize by these enzyme have property that suggest the existence of an additional factor need to terminate transcription correctly in walter fiers become the first person to actually prove the existence of the terminate enzyme roger kornberg win the nobel prize in chemistry for his study of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription electron micrograph of transcription of ribosomal rna the forming ribosomal rna strand be visible a branch from the main dna strand transcription can be measure and detect in a variety of way cassette transcription assay measure promoter strength transcription assay identifies transcription start site tss nuclear assay measure the relative abundance of newly form transcript rnase protection assay and of rnap detect active transcription sit measure the absolute abundance of total or nuclear rna level which may however differ from transcription rate dna microarrays measure the relative abundance of the global total or nuclear rna level however these may differ from transcription rate in situ hybridization detect the presence of a transcript tagging by incorporate rna stem loop such a into a gene these become incorporated into newly synthesize rna the stem loop can then be detect use a fusion of gfp and the coat protein which have a high affinity interaction with the stem loop the recruitment of gfp to the site of transcription be visualize a a single fluorescent spot this new approach have reveal that transcription occur in discontinuous burst or pulse see transcriptional bursting with the notable exception of in situ technique most other method provide cell population average and be not capable of detect this fundamental property of gene northern blot the traditional method and until the advent of the most quantitative applies sequence technique to sequence whole transcriptomes which allow the measurement of relative abundance of rna as well a the detection of additional variation such a fusion gene edits and novel splice site cell amplifies and read partial transcriptomes from isolated cell allow for detailed analysis of rna in tissue embryo and cancer scheme of reverse transcription some virus such a hiv the cause of aid have the ability to transcribe rna into dna hiv have an rna genome that be reverse transcribe into dna the result dna can be merge with the dna genome of the host cell the main enzyme responsible for synthesis of dna from an rna template be call reverse transcriptase in the case of hiv reverse transcriptase be responsible for synthesize a complementary dna strand cdna to the viral rna genome the enzyme ribonuclease h then digest the rna strand and reverse transcriptase synthesise a complementary strand of dna to form a double helix dna structure cdna the cdna be integrate into the host cell genome by the enzyme integrase which cause the host cell to generate viral protein that reassemble into new viral particle in hiv subsequent to this the host cell undergoes program cell death or apoptosis of t cell however in other retrovirus the host cell remain intact a the virus bud out of the cell some eukaryotic cell contain an enzyme with reverse transcription activity call telomerase telomerase be a reverse transcriptase that lengthen the end of linear chromosome telomerase carry an rna template from which it synthesize a repeat sequence of dna or junk dna this repeat sequence of dna be call a telomere and can be think of a a cap for a chromosome it be important because every time a linear chromosome be duplicate it be shorten with this junk dna or cap at the end of chromosome the shortening eliminate some of the repeated sequence rather than the dna sequence that be farther away from the chromosome end telomerase be often activate in cancer cell to enable cancer cell to duplicate their genome indefinitely without lose important dna sequence activation of telomerase could be part of the process that allow cancer cell to become immortal the immortalizing factor of cancer via telomere lengthen due to telomerase have be prove to occur in of all carcinogenic tumor in vivo with the remain use an alternative telomere maintenance route call alt or alternative lengthening of telomere crick central dogma in which the

alternative splicing produce three protein isoforms alternative splice or rna splicing or splicing be a regulated process during gene expression that result in a single gene cod for multiple protein in this process particular exon of a gene may be include within or exclude from the final process messenger rna mrna produce from that gene consequently the protein translate from alternatively splice mrna will contain difference in their amino acid sequence and often in their biological function see figure notably alternative splicing allow the human genome to direct the synthesis of many more protein than would be expect from it gene alternative splice occurs a a normal phenomenon in eukaryote where it greatly increase the biodiversity of protein that can be encode by the genome in human of gene be alternatively splice there be numerous mode of alternative splice observed of which the most common be exon skip in this mode a particular exon may be include in mrna under some condition or in particular tissue and omit from the mrna in others the production of alternatively splice mrna be regulate by a system of protein that bind to site on the primary transcript itself such protein include splice activator that promote the usage of a particular splice site and splice repressor that reduce the usage of a particular site mechanism of alternative splice be highly variable and new example be constantly be find particularly through the use of technique researcher hope to fully elucidate the regulatory system involve in splice so that alternative splicing product from a give gene under particular condition splice variant could be predict by a splicing code abnormal variation in splice be also implicate in disease a large proportion of human genetic disorder result from splice variant abnormal splice variant be also think to contribute to the development of cancer and splice factor gene be frequently mutate in different type of cancer alternative splicing be first observe in the adenovirus produce five primary transcript early in it infectious cycle prior to viral dna replication and an additional one later after dna replication begin the early primary transcript continue to be produce after dna replication begin the additional primary transcript produce late in infection be large and come from of the adenovirus genome this be much large than any of the individual adenovirus mrna present in infected cell researcher find that the primary rna transcript produce by adenovirus type in the late phase be splice in many different way result in mrna encode different viral protein in addition the primary transcript contain multiple polyadenylation sit give different end for the processed mrna in the first example of alternative splicing in a transcript from a normal endogenous gene be characterize the gene encode the thyroid hormone calcitonin be find to be alternatively splice in mammalian cell the primary transcript from this gene contain exon the calcitonin mrna contain exon and terminates after a polyadenylation site in exon another mrna be produce from this by skip exon and include exon and it encode a protein know a cgrp calcitonin gene related peptide example of alternative splicing in immunoglobin gene transcript in mammal be also observe in the early since then alternative splicing have be find to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes the for alternative splicing be a d melanogaster gene call dscam which could potentially have splice variant traditional classification of basic type of alternative rna splice event exon be represent a blue and yellow block intron a line in between relative frequency of type of alternative splice event differ between human and fruit basic mode of alternative splicing be generally recognize skipping or exon in this case an exon may be splice out of the primary transcript or retain this be the most common mode in mammalian exclusive exon one of two exon be retain in mrna after splice but not both donor site an alternative splice junction donor site be use change the boundary of the upstream exon acceptor site an alternative splice junction acceptor site be use change the boundary of the downstream exon retention a sequence may be splice out a an intron or simply retain this be distinguish from exon skipping because the retained sequence be not flank by intron if the retained intron be in the coding region the intron must encode amino acid in frame with the neighboring exon or a stop codon or a shift in the reading frame will cause the protein to be this be the rare mode in mammal in addition to these primary mode of alternative splicing there be two other main mechanism by which different mrna may be generate from the same gene multiple promoter and multiple polyadenylation site use of multiple promoter be properly describe a a transcriptional regulation mechanism rather than alternative splicing by start transcription at different point transcript with different exon can be generate at the other end multiple polyadenylation site provide different end point for the transcript both of these mechanism be find in combination with alternative splicing and provide additional variety in mrna derive from a gene schematic cutoff from splice structure in the murine hyaluronidase gene directionality of transcription from to be show from leave to right exon and intron be not draw to scale these mode describe basic splice mechanism but may be inadequate to describe complex splice event for instance the figure to the right show spliceforms from the mouse hyaluronidase gene compare the exonic structure show in the first line green with the one in the second line yellow show intron retention whereas the comparison between the second and the third spliceform yellow blue exhibit exon skip a model nomenclature to uniquely designate all possible splicing pattern have recently be propose splice spliceosome a complex define the and end of the intron before removal when the have be transcribe from the dna it include several intron and exon in nematode the mean be exon and intron in the fruit fly drosophila there can be more than intron and exon in one transcribe the exon to be retain in the mrna be determine during the splice process the regulation and selection of splice site be do by splice activator and splice repressor protein as well a element within the itself such a exonic splice enhancer and exonic splicing silencer the typical eukaryotic nuclear intron have consensus sequence define important region each intron have the sequence gu at it end near the end there be a branch site the nucleotide at the branchpoint be always an a the consensus around this sequence vary somewhat in human the branch site consensus sequence be yunay the branch site be follow by a series of pyrimidine the polypyrimidine tract then by ag at the end splicing of mrna be perform by an rna and protein complex know a the spliceosome contain snrnps designate and be not involve in mrna splice bind to the gu and with the assistance of the protein factor bind to the branchpoint a within the branch site the complex at this stage be know a the spliceosome a complex formation of the a complex be usually the key step in determine the end of the intron to be splice out and define the end of the exon to be retain the u nomenclature derives from their high uridine content the complex bind and replace the position and leave the remain complex then perform two transesterification reaction in the first transesterification end of the intron be cleave from the upstream exon and join to the branch site a by a linkage in the second transesterification the end of the intron be cleave from the downstream exon and the two exon be join by a phosphodiester bond the intron be then release in lariat form and degraded element and splice repression splicing be regulate by protein repressor and activator and correspond regulatory site silencer and enhancer on the however a part of the complexity of alternative splice it be note that the effect of a splicing factor be frequently that be a splice factor that serve a a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve a a repressor when bound to it splice element in the context of an exon and vice versa the secondary structure of the transcript also play a role in regulate splice such a by bring together splice element or by mask a sequence that would otherwise serve a a binding element for a splicing factor together these element form a splicing code that govern how splicing will occur under different cellular condition there be two major type of rna sequence element present in and they have correspond protein splice silencer be site to which splice repressor protein bind reduce the probability that a nearby site will be use a a splice junction these can be locate in the intron itself intronic splice silencer iss or in a neighboring exon exonic splice silencer es they vary in sequence as well a in the type of protein that bind to them the majority of splice repressor be heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnrnps such a and polypyrimidine tract bind protein ptb splice enhancer be site to which splice activator protein bind increase the probability that a nearby site will be use a a splice junction these also may occur in the intron intronic splice enhancer ise or exon exonic splice enhancer ese most of the activator proteins that bind to i and es be member of the sr protein family such protein contain rna recognition motif and arginine and r domain splice activation in general the determinant of splice work in an manner that depend on context so that the rule govern how splicing be regulate from a splice code the presence of a particular rna sequence element may increase the probability that a nearby site will be splice in some case but decrease the probability in other case depend on context the context within which regulatory element act include context that be establish by the presence of other rna sequence feature and context that be establish by cellular condition for example some rna sequence element influence splice only if multiple element be present in the same region so a to establish context a another example a element can have opposite effect on splice depend on which protein be express in the cell neuronal versus ptb the adaptive significance of splice silencer and enhancer be attest by study show that there be strong selection in human gene against mutation that produce new silencer or disrupt exist enhancer dna methylation and alternative splicing in social insect cpg dna methylation have show a role to regulate the alternative splicing in social insect in honey bee apis mellifera cpg dna methylation seem to regulate the exon skip base on the first few genomic study after honey bee genome be available cpg dna methylation regulate alternative splice more extensively not only affect exon skip but also intron retention and other splice event skip drosophila dsx alternative splicing of dsx from the d melanogaster gene dsx contain exon in male exon and be join to form the mrna which encode a transcriptional regulatory protein require for male development in female exon and be join and a polyadenylation signal in exon cause cleavage of the mrna at that point the result mrna be a transcriptional regulatory protein require for female development this be an example of exon skip the intron upstream from exon have a polypyrimidine tract that do match the consensus sequence well so that proteins bind poorly to it without assistance from splice activator this splice acceptor site be therefore not use in male female however produce the splicing activator transformer tra see below the sr protein be produce in both sex and bind to an ese in exon if tra be present it bind to and along with another sr protein form a complex that assist protein in bind to the weak polypyrimidine tract be recruit to the associate branchpoint and this lead to inclusion of exon in the mrna acceptor sit drosophila transformer alternative splicing of the drosophila transformer gene product of the transformer tra gene of drosophila melanogaster undergo alternative splicing via the alternative acceptor site mode the gene tra encode a protein that be express only in female the primary transcript of this gene contain an intron with two possible acceptor site in male the upstream acceptor site be use this cause a long version of exon to be include in the processed transcript include an early stop codon the result mrna encode a truncated protein product that be inactive female produce the master sex determination protein sex lethal sxl the sxl protein be a splice repressor that bind to an i in the rna of the tra transcript near the upstream acceptor site prevent protein from bind to the polypyrimidine tract this prevent the use of this junction shift the spliceosome binding to the downstream acceptor site splice at this point bypass the stop codon which be excise a part of the intron the result mrna encode an active tra protein which itself be a regulator of alternative splicing of other gene see dsx above definition fa alternative splicing of the fas receptor multiple isoforms of the fas receptor protein be produce by alternative splice two normally occur isoforms in human be produce by an mechanism an mrna include exon encodes the form of the fa receptor which promote apoptosis or program cell death increase expression of fas receptor in skin cell chronically expose to the sun and absence of expression in skin cancer cell suggest that this mechanism may be important in elimination of cell in human if exon be skip the result mrna encode a soluble fa protein that do not promote apoptosis the inclusion or skipping of the exon depend on two antagonistic protein and polypyrimidine protein ptb donor site in the intron downstream from exon in the have a weak agreement with the consensus sequence and be not bind usually by the snrnp if do not bind the exon be skip see a in accompany figure of protein to an intronic splicing enhancer site stabilize binding of the snrnp the result donor site complex assist in binding of the splice factor to the splice site upstream of the exon through a mechanism that be not yet know see b contain a exonic splicing silencer where ptb can bind if ptb bind it inhibit the effect of the donor complex on the binding of to the acceptor site result in exon skip see c this mechanism be an example of exon definition in splice a spliceosome assembles on an intron and the snrnp subunits fold the rna so that the and end of the intron be join however recently study example such a this one show that there be also interaction between the end of the exon in this particular case these exon definition interaction be necessary to allow the binding of core splicing factor prior to assembly of the spliceosomes on the two flanking intron competition tat exon alternative splicing of tat exon hiv the retrovirus that cause aid in human produce a single primary rna transcript which be alternatively splice in multiple way to produce over different mrna equilibrium among differentially splice transcript provide multiple mrna encode different product that be require for viral multiplication one of the differentially splice transcript contain the tat gene in which exon be a cassette exon that may be skip or include the inclusion of tat exon in the rna be regulate by competition between the splice repressor hnrnp and the sr protein within exon an exonic splicing silencer sequence es and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence ese overlap if repressor protein bind to the es it initiate cooperative binding of multiple molecule extend into the donor site upstream of exon and prevent the binding of the core splice factor to the polypyrimidine tract if bind to the ese it prevent bind and maintain the donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mrna type with and without exon be produce alternative splicing be one of several exception to the original idea that one dna sequence code for one polypeptide the one enzyme hypothesis it might be more correct now to say one gene many polypeptide external information be need in order to decide which polypeptide be produce give a dna sequence and since the method of regulation be inherit this provide novel way for mutation to affect gene expression it have be propose that for eukaryote alternative splicing be a very important step towards higher efficiency because information can be store much more economically several protein can be encode by a single gene rather than require a separate gene for each and thus allow a more varied proteome from a genome of limited size it also provide evolutionary flexibility a single point mutation may cause a give exon to be occasionally exclude or include from a transcript during splice allow production of a new protein isoform without loss of the original protein study have identify intrinsically disordered region see intrinsically unstructured protein a enrich in the exon suggest that protein isoforms may display functional diversity due to the alteration of functional module within these region such functional diversity achieve by isoforms be reflect by their expression pattern and can be predict by machine learning approach comparative study indicate that alternative splicing precede multicellularity in evolution and suggest that this mechanism might have be to assist in the development of multicellular organism research base on the human genome project and other genome sequencing have show that human have only about more gene than the roundworm caenorhabditis elegans and only about twice as many a the fly drosophila melanogaster this finding lead to speculation that the perceived great complexity of human or vertebrate generally might be due to high rate of alternative splicing in human than be find in invertebrate however a study on sample of est each from human mouse rat cow fly d melanogaster worm c elegans and the plant arabidopsis thaliana find no large difference in frequency of alternatively splice gene among human and any of the other animal test another study however propose that these result be an artifact of the different number of est available for the various organism when they compare alternative splice frequency in random subset of gene from each organism the author conclude that vertebrate do have high rate of alternative splice than invertebrate change in the rna process machinery may lead to of multiple transcript while alteration in splice site or splice regulatory site may lead to difference in splicing of a single gene and thus in the mrna produce from a mutant gene transcript a study in involve probabilistic analysis indicate that great than of human mutation affect splice rather than directly affect cod sequence a more recent study indicate that of all hereditary disease be likely to have a splicing component regardless of exact percentage a number of disease do exist a describe below a prominent example of disease be cancer abnormally splice mrna be also find in a high proportion of cancerous cell combine and proteomics analysis have reveal striking differential expression of splice isoforms of key protein in important cancer pathway it be not always clear whether such aberrant pattern of splice contribute to the cancerous growth or be merely consequence of cellular abnormality associate with cancer for certain type of cancer like in colorectal and prostate the number of splice error per cancer have be show to vary greatly between individual cancer a phenomenon refer to a transcriptome instability transcriptome instability have far be show to correlate grealty with reduced expression level of splice factor gene mutation of have be demonstrate to contribute to hematologic malignancy and that cell line exhibit transcriptome instability a compare to their isogenic wildtype counterpart in fact there be actually a reduction of alternative splicing in cancerous cell compare to normal one and the type of splice differ for instance cancerous cell show high level of intron retention than normal cell but low level of exon skip some of the difference in splice in cancerous cell may be due to the high frequency of somatic mutation in splice factor gene and some may result from change in phosphorylation of splice factor others may be produce by change in the relative amount of splice factor produce for instance breast cancer cell have be show to have increase level of the splice factor one study find that a relatively small percentage out of over of alternative splice variant be significantly high in frequency in tumor cell than normal cell suggest that there be a limited set of gene which when contribute to tumor development it be believe however that the deleterious effect of transcript be usually safeguard and eliminate by a cellular posttranscriptional quality control mechanism term mrna decay nmd one example of a specific splicing variant associate with cancer be in one of the human dnmt gene three dnmt gene encode enzyme that add methyl group to dna a modification that often have regulatory effect several abnormally splice mrna be find in tumor and cancer cell line in two separate study expression of two of these abnormally splice mrna in mammalian cell cause change in the dna methylation pattern in those cell cell with one of the abnormal mrna also grow twice as fast a control cell indicate a direct contribution to tumor development by this product another example be the ron an important property of cancerous cell be their ability to move and invade normal tissue production of an abnormally spliced transcript of ron have be find to be associate with increased level of the in breast cancer cell the abnormal isoform of the ron protein encode by this mrna lead to cell motility overexpression of a truncated splice variant of the fosb gene δfosb in a specific population of neuron in the nucleus accumbens have be identify a the causal mechanism involve in the induction and maintenance of an addiction to drug and natural reward recent provocative study point to a key function of chromatin structure and histone modification in alternative splice regulation these insight suggest that epigenetic regulation determine not only what part of the genome be express but also how they be spliced analysis of alternative splicing be a challenge task typically alternatively splice transcript have be find by compare est sequence but this require sequence of very large number of est most est library come from a very limited number of tissue so splice variant be likely to be miss in any case approach to investigate splicing have however be develop such a dna analysis assay and deep sequencing these method can be use to screen for polymorphism or mutation in or around splice element that affect protein binding when combine with splice assay include in vivo reporter gene assay the functional effect of polymorphism or mutation on the splicing of transcript can then be analyze in microarray analysis array of dna fragment represent individual exon affymetrix exon microarray or boundary array from exonhit or jivan have be use the array be then probe with labeled cdna from tissue of interest the probe cdna bind to dna from the exon that be include in mrna in their tissue of origin or to dna from the boundary where two exon have be join this can reveal the presence of particular alternatively splice mrna clip and immunoprecipitation us uv radiation to link protein to rna molecule in a tissue during splice a splice regulatory protein of interest be then precipitate use specific antibody when the rna attach to that protein be isolate and clone it reveal the target sequence for that protein another method for identify protein and map their binding to transcript be microarray evaluation of genomic aptamers by shift megashift this method involve an adaptation of the systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment selex method together with a readout use of the megashift method have provide insight into the regulation of alternative splicing by allow for the identification of sequence in transcript surround alternatively splice exon that mediate bind to different splice factor such a and ptb this approach have also be use to aid in determine the relationship between rna secondary structure and the binding of splice factor deep sequence technology have be use to conduct analysis of mrna unprocessed and process thus provide insight into alternative splicing for example result from use of deep sequencing indicate that in human an estimate of transcript from multiexon gene undergo alternative splicing with a number of transcript splice in a manner functional genomics and computational approach base on multiple instance learning have also be develop to integrate data to predict function for alternatively spliced isoforms deep sequencing have also aid in the in vivo detection of the transient lariats that be release during splice the determination of branch site sequence and the mapping of branchpoints in human transcript use of reporter assay make it possible to find the splicing proteins involve in a specific alternative splicing event by construct reporter gene that will express one of two different fluorescent protein depend on the splice reaction that occur this method have be use to isolate mutant affect splicing and thus to identify novel splice regulatory protein inactivate in those mutant there be a collection of alternative splicing databases these database be useful for find gene have

the equation equation or sometimes equation be a relativistic wave equation relate to the schrödinger equation it be in space and time and manifestly it be a quantized version of the relativistic relation it solution include a quantum scalar or pseudoscalar field a field whose quantum be spinless particle it theoretical relevance be similar to that of the dirac equation electromagnetic interaction can be incorporate form the topic of scalar electrodynamics but because common spinless particle like the pion be unstable and also experience the strong interaction with unknown interaction term in the hamiltonian the practical utility be limit the equation can be put into the form of a schrödinger equation in this form it be express a two couple differential equation each of first order in time the solution have two component reflect the charge degree of freedom in relativity it admit a conserved quantity but this be not positive definite the wave function can not therefore be interpret a a probability amplitude the conserved quantity be instead interpret a electric charge and the norm square of the wave function be interpret a a charge density the equation describe all spinless particle with positive negative and zero charge any solution of the free dirac equation be a solution of the free equation the equation do not form the basis of a consistent quantum relativistic theory there be no known such theory for particle of any spin for full reconciliation of quantum mechanic with special relativity quantum field theory be need in which the equation reemerges a the equation obey by the component of all free quantum field others like walter greiner do in his series on theoretical physic give a full account of the historical development and view of relativistic quantum mechanic before they get to the modern interpretation with the rationale that it be highly desirable or even necessary from a pedagogical point of view to take the long route in quantum field theory the solution of the free noninteracting version of the original equation still play a role they be need to build the hilbert space fock space and to express quantum field by use complete set span set of hilbert space of wave function the equation with mass parameter be solution of the equation be function of the time variable and space variable the laplacian act on the space variables only the equation be often abbreviate a where and be the operator define by we be use the metric signature the equation be often write in natural unit the form of the equation be derive by require that solution of the equation obey the relation of special relativity unlike the schrödinger equation the equation admit two value of for each one positive and one negative only by separate out the positive and negative frequency part do one obtain an equation describe a relativistic wavefunction for the case the equation become which be formally the same a the homogeneous screen poisson equation the equation be name after the physicist oskar klein and walter gordon who in propose that it describe relativistic electron other author make similar claim in that same year be vladimir fock johann kudar théophile de donder and van den dungen and louis de broglie although it turn out that model the electron spin require the dirac equation the equation correctly describe the spinless relativistic composite particle like the pion on july european organization for nuclear research cern announce the discovery of the higgs boson since the higgs boson be a particle it be the first observe ostensibly elementary particle to be describe by the equation further experimentation and analysis be require to discern whether the higgs boson observe be that of the standard model or a more exotic possibly composite form the equation be first consider a a quantum wave equation by schrödinger in his search for an equation describe de broglie wave the equation be find in his notebook from late and he appear to have prepare a manuscript apply it to the hydrogen atom yet because it fail to take into account the electron spin the equation predict the hydrogen atom fine structure incorrectly include overestimate the overall magnitude of the splitting pattern by a factor of for the energy level the dirac equation relativistic spectrum be however easily recover if the quantum number be replace by total quantum number in january schrödinger submit for publication instead his equation a approximation that predict the bohr energy level of hydrogen without fine structure in soon after the schrödinger equation be introduce vladimir fock write an article about it generalization for the case of magnetic field where force be dependent on velocity and independently derive this equation both klein and fock use kaluza and klein method fock also determine the gauge theory for the wave equation the equation for a free particle have a simple solution the equation for the energy of a free particle be by quantize this we get the schrödinger equation for a free particle where be the momentum operator be the del operator and be the energy operator the schrödinger equation suffers from not be relativistically invariant meaning that it be inconsistent with special relativity it be natural to try to use the identity from special relativity describe the energy then just insert the operator for momentum and energy yield the equation the square root of a differential operator can be define with the help of fourier transformation but due to the asymmetry of space and time derivative dirac find it impossible to include external electromagnetic field in a relativistically invariant way so he look for another equation that can be modify in order to describe the action of electromagnetic force in addition this equation a it stand be nonlocal see also introduction to nonlocal equation klein and gordon instead begin with the square of the above identity which when quantize give which simplify to rearrange term yield since all reference to imaginary number have be eliminate from this equation it can be apply to field that be as well a those that have complex value rewrite the first two term use the inverse of the minkowski metric and write the einstein summation convention explicitly we get thus the equation can be write in a covariant notation this often mean an abbreviation in the form of where and this operator be call the operator today this form be interpret a the relativistic field equation for particle furthermore any component of any solution to the free dirac equation for a particle be automatically a solution to the free equation this generalize to particle of any spin due extension to the equation furthermore in quantum field theory every component of every quantum field must satisfy the free equation make the equation a generic expression of quantum field equation in a potential the equation can be generalize to describe a field in some potential a the conserved current associate to the u symmetry of a complex field satisfy the equation read the form of the conserved current can be derive systematically by apply noether theorem to the u symmetry we will not do so here but simply give a proof that this conserved current be correct proof use algebraic manipulation from the kg equation from the equation for a complex field of mass write in covariant notation and it complex conjugate we have multiply by the left respectively by and and omit for brevity the explicit dependence subtract the former from the latter we obtain then we also know from which we obtain the conservation law for the field the equation for a free particle can be write a we look for solution of the form for some constant angular frequency and wave number substitution give the dispersion relation energy and momentum be see to be proportional to and so the dispersion relation be just the classic relativistic equation for massless particle we may set recover the relationship between energy and momentum for massless particles the equation can also be derive by a variational method consider the action where be the field and be it mass the complex conjugate of be write if the scalar field be take to be then and it be customary to introduce a factor of for both term apply the formula for the hilbert tensor to the lagrangian density the quantity inside the integral we can derive the tensor of the scalar field it be by integration of the component over all space one may show that both the and solution can be physically associate with particle with positive energy this be not the case for the dirac equation and it tensor take the limit of a classical field begin with the ansatz factor the oscillatory rest mass energy term define the kinetic energy in the limit and hence apply this yield the limit of the second time derivative of substitute into the free equation yield which by divide out the exponential and subtract the mass term simplifies to this be a classical schrödinger field the analogous limit of a quantum field be complicate by the of the field operator in the limit the creation and annihilation operator decouple and behave a independent quantum schrödinger field there be a simple way to make any field interact with electromagnetism in a way replace the derivative operator with the derivative operator this be because to maintain symmetry of the physical equation for the wavefunction under a local u gauge transformation where be a locally variable phase angle which transformation redirect the wavefunction in the complex phase space define by it be require that ordinary derivative be replace by derivative while the gauge field transform a the equation therefore become in natural unit where be the vector potential while it be possible to add many term for example these term be not renormalizable in dimension the field equation for a charged scalar field multiplies by which mean that the field must be complex in order for a field to be charge it must have two component that can rotate into each other the real and imaginary part the action for a massless charge scalar be the covariant version of the uncharged action in general relativity we include the effect of gravity by replace partial with covariant derivative and the equation

in the mathematical field of differential geometry and tensor calculus form be an approach to multivariable calculus that be independent of coordinate differential form provide a unified approach to define integrands over curve surface solid and manifold the modern notion of differential form be pioneer by élie cartan it have many application especially in geometry topology and physic for instance the expression from calculus be an example of a and can be integrate over an oriented interval in the domain of similarly the expression be a that have a surface integral over an oriented surface the symbol denote the exterior product sometimes call the wedge product of two differential form likewise a represent a volume element that can be integrate over an oriented region of space in general a be an object that may be integrate over orient manifold and be homogeneous of degree in the coordinate differentials the algebra of differential form be organize in a way that naturally reflect the orientation of the domain of integration there be an operation on differential form know a the exterior derivative that when give a a input produce a a output this operation extend the differential of a function and be directly relate to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that make the fundamental theorem of calculus the divergence theorem green theorem and stokes theorem special case of the same general result know in this context also a the generalized stokes theorem in a deep way this theorem relate the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential form themselves the precise connection be know a de rham theorem the general setting for the study of differential form be on a differentiable manifold differential be naturally dual to vector field on a manifold and the pairing between vector field and be extend to arbitrary differential form by the interior product the algebra of differential form along with the exterior derivative define on it be preserve by the pullback under smooth function between two manifold this feature allow geometrically invariant information to be move from one space to another via the pullback provide that the information be express in term of differential form a an example the change of variable formula for integration become a simple statement that an integral be preserve under pullback differential form be part of the field of differential geometry influence by linear algebra although the notion of a differential be quite old the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential form be usually credit to élie cartan with reference to his paper some aspect of the exterior algebra of differential form appear in hermann grassmann work die lineale ausdehnungslehre ein neuer zweig der mathematik the theory of linear extension a new branch of mathematics differential form provide an approach to multivariable calculus that be independent of coordinate and a differential can be integrate over an oriented manifold of dimension a differential can be think of a measure an infinitesimal oriented length or orient density a differential can be think of a measure an infinitesimal oriented area or orient density and so on integration of differential form be only on orient manifold an example of a manifold be an interval and interval can be give an orientation they be positively orient if and negatively orient otherwise if then the integral of the differential over the interval with it natural positive orientation be which be the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval when equip with the opposite orientation that be this give a geometrical context to the convention for integral that the sign change when the orientation of the interval be reverse a standard explanation of this in integration theory be that when the limit of integration be in the opposite order the increment be negative in the direction of integration more generally an be an oriented density that can be integrate over an oriented manifold for example a can be integrate over an orient curve a can be integrate over an oriented surface etc if be an oriented manifold and be the same manifold with opposite orientation and be an then one have these convention correspond to interpret the integrand a a differential form integrate over a chain in measure theory by contrast one interpret the integrand a a function with respect to a measure and integrate over a subset without any notion of orientation one write to indicate integration over a subset this be a minor distinction in one dimension but become subtler on manifold see below for detail make the notion of an oriented density precise and thus of a differential form involve the exterior algebra the basic be the differential of the coordinate each of these represent a covector that measure a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction a general be a linear combination of these differential where the be function of all the coordinate a differential be integrate along an oriented curve a a line integral the basic be expression where this represent an infinitesimal orient square parallel to the a general be a linear combination of these and it be integrate just like a surface integral a fundamental operation define on differential form be the exterior product the symbol be the wedge this be similar to the cross product from vector calculus in that it be an alternating product for instance because the square whose first side be and second side be be to be regard a have the opposite orientation a the square whose first side be and whose second side be this be why we only need to sum over expression with for example the exterior product allow differential form to be build out of one in much the same way that the cross product in vector calculus allow one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vector point up the two side alternate also imply that in the same way that the cross product of parallel vector whose magnitude be the area of the parallelogram span by those vector be zero in high dimension if any two of the index im be equal in the same way that the volume enclose by a parallelotope whose be linearly dependent be zero notation a common notation for the wedge product of elementary be so called notation in an n context for we define another useful notation be obtain by define the set of all strictly increase of length k in a space of dimension n denote then locally wherever the coordinate apply span the space of differential k in a manifold m of dimension n when view a a module over the ring of smooth function on m by calculate the size of combinatorially the module of k on a n manifold and in general space of on an n vector space be n choose k this also demonstrate that there be no nonzero differential form of degree great than the dimension of the underlie manifold the exterior derivative in addition to the exterior product there be also the exterior derivative operator the exterior derivative of a differential form be a generalization of the differential of a function in the sense that the exterior derivative of be exactly the differential of f when generalize to high form if be a simple k then it exterior derivative be a define by take the differential of the coefficient function with extension to general occur linearly if then it exterior derivative be it be worth note that in after equate vector with their dual covectors the exterior derivative corresponds to gradient curl and divergence although this correspondence like the cross product do not generalize to high dimension and should be treat with some caution the exterior derivative itself generalize to arbitrary finite dimension and be a flexible and powerful tool with wide application in differential geometry differential topology and many area in physic of note although the above definition of the exterior derivative be define with respect to local coordinate it can be define in an entirely manner a an antiderivation of degree on the exterior algebra of differential form the benefit of this more general approach be that it allow for a natural approach to integration on manifold it also allow for a natural generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus call the generalized stokes theorem which be a central result in the theory of integration on manifold let be an open set in a differential be define to be a smooth function on the set of which be denote if be any vector in then have a directional derivative which be another function on whose value at a point be the rate of change at of in the direction this notion can be extend to the case that be a vector field on by evaluate at the point in the definition in particular if be the th coordinate vector then be the partial derivative of with respect to the th coordinate function where be the coordinate function on by their very definition partial derivative depend upon the choice of coordinate if new coordinate be introduce then the first idea lead to differential form be the observation that be a linear function of for any vector and any real number at each point p this linear map from to be denote and call the derivative or differential of at thus extend over the whole set the object can be view a a function that take a vector field on u and return a function whose value at each point be the derivative along the vector field of the function f note that at each the differential be not a real number but a linear functional on tangent vector and a prototypical example of a differential since any vector be a linear combination of it component be uniquely determine by for each and each which be just the partial derivative of on thus provide a way of encode the partial derivative of it can be decode by notice that the coordinate be themselves function on and so define differential let since the kronecker delta function it follow that the meaning of this expression be give by evaluate both side at an arbitrary point on the right hand side the sum be define pointwise so that apply both side to the result on each side be the th partial derivative of at since and be arbitrary this prove the formula more generally for any smooth function and on we define the differential pointwise by for each any differential arises this way and by use it follow that any differential on may be express in coordinate a for some smooth function on the second idea lead to differential form arises from the following question give a differential on when do there exist a function on such that the above expansion reduce this question to the search for a function whose partial derivative be equal to give function for such a function do not always exist any smooth function satisfies so it will be impossible to find such an unless for all and the of the left hand side in and suggest introduce an antisymmetric product on differential the exterior product so that these equation can be combine into a single condition where be define so that this be an example of a differential this be call the exterior derivative of it be give by to summarize be a necessary condition for the existence of a function with differential and be special case of differential form for each there be a space of differential which can be express in term of the coordinate a for a collection of function antisymmetry which be already present for make it possible to restrict the sum to those set of index for which differential form can be multiply together use the exterior product and for any differential there be a differential call the exterior derivative of differential form the exterior product and the exterior derivative be independent of a choice of coordinate consequently they may be define on any smooth manifold one way to do this be cover with coordinate chart and define a differential on to be a family of differential on each chart which agree on the overlap however there be more intrinsic definition which make the independence of coordinate manifest let be a smooth manifold a smooth differential form of degree be a smooth section of the th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of the set of all differential on a manifold be a vector space often denote the definition of a differential form may be restate a follow at any point a defines an element where be the tangent space to at and be it dual space this space be naturally isomorphic to the fiber at of the dual bundle of the th exterior power of the tangent bundle of that be be also a linear functional the dual of the k th exterior power be isomorphic to the k th exterior power of the dual by the universal property of exterior power this be equivalently an alternate multilinear map consequently a differential may be evaluate against any of tangent vector to the same point of for example a differential assigns to each point a linear functional on in the presence of an inner product on induce by a riemannian metric on may be represent a the inner product with a tangent vector differential be sometimes call covariant vector field covector field or dual vector field particularly within physic the exterior algebra may be embed in the tensor algebra by mean of the alternation map the alternation map be define a a mapping for a tensor at a point where be the symmetric group on element the alternation map be constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generate by the symmetric and therefore descends to an embed this map exhibit a a totally antisymmetric covariant tensor field of rank the differential form on be in correspondence with such tensor field as well a the addition and multiplication by scalar operation which arise from the vector space structure there be several other standard operation define on differential form the most important operation be the exterior product of two differential form the exterior derivative of a single differential form the interior product of a differential form and a vector field the lie derivative of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the covariant derivative of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection exterior product the exterior product of a and an be a denote at each point of the manifold the form and be element of an exterior power of the cotangent space at when the exterior algebra be view a a quotient of the tensor algebra the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product modulo the equivalence relation define the exterior algebra the antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra mean that when be view a a multilinear functional it be alternate however when the exterior algebra embed a subspace of the tensor algebra by mean of the alternation map the tensor product be not alternate there be an explicit formula which describe the exterior product in this situation the exterior product be this description be useful for explicit computation for example if then be the whose value at a point be the alternate bilinear form define by for the exterior product be bilinear if and be any differential form and if be any smooth function then it be skew commutative also know a graded commutative meaning that it satisfy a variant of anticommutativity that depend on the degree of the form if be a and be an then riemannian manifold on a riemannian manifold or more generally a manifold the metric define a isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent space this make it possible to convert vector field to covector field and vice versa it also enable the definition of additional operation such a the hodge star operator and the codifferential which have degree and be adjoint to the exterior differential vector field structure on a manifold can be identify with vector field vector field have additional distinct algebraic structure which be list here for context and to avoid confusion firstly each co tangent space generate a clifford algebra where the product of a co vector with itself be give by the value of a quadratic form in this case the natural one induce by the metric this algebra be distinct from the exterior algebra of differential form which can be view a a clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes since the exterior product of any vector with itself be zero clifford algebra be thus quantum deformation of the exterior algebra they be study in geometric algebra another alternative be to consider vector field a derivation the noncommutative algebra of differential operator they generate be the weyl algebra and be a noncommutative quantum deformation of the symmetric algebra in the vector field differential one important property of the exterior derivative be that this mean that the exterior derivative defines a cochain complex this complex be call the de rham complex and it cohomology be by definition the de rham cohomology of by the poincaré lemma the de rham complex be locally exact except at the kernel at be the space of locally constant function on therefore the complex be a resolution of the constant sheaf which in turn implies a form of de rham theorem de rham cohomology compute the sheaf cohomology of suppose that be smooth the differential of be a smooth map between the tangent bundle of and this map be also denote and call the for any point and any there be a pushforward vector in however the same be not true of a vector field if be not injective say because have two or more preimages then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vector in if be not surjective then will be a point at which do not determine any tangent vector at all since a vector field on determines by definition a unique tangent vector at every point of the pushforward of a vector field do not always exist by contrast it be always possible to pull back a differential form a differential form on may be view a a linear functional on each tangent space precomposing this functional with the differential define a linear functional on each tangent space of and therefore a differential form on the existence of pullback be one of the key feature of the theory of differential form it lead to the existence of pullback map in other situation such a pullback homomorphism in de rham cohomology formally let be smooth and let be a smooth on then there be a differential form on call the of which capture the behavior of a see relative to to define the pullback fix a point of and tangent vector to at the pullback of be define by the formula there be several more abstract way to view this definition if be a on then it may be view a a section of the cotangent bundle of use to denote a dual map the dual to the differential of be the pullback of may be define to be the composite this be a section of the cotangent bundle of and hence a differential on in full generality let denote the th exterior power of the dual map to the differential then the pullback of a be the composite another abstract way to view the pullback come from view a a a linear functional on tangent space from this point of view be a morphism of vector bundle where be the trivial rank one bundle on the composite map define a linear functional on each tangent space of and therefore it factor through the trivial bundle the vector bundle morphism define in this way be pullback respect all of the basic operation on form if and be form and be a real number then the pullback of a form can also be write in coordinate assume that be coordinate on that be coordinate on and that these coordinate system be relate by the formula for all locally on can be write a where for each choice of be a function of use the linearity of pullback and it compatibility with exterior product the pullback of have the formula each exterior derivative can be expand in term of the resulting can be write use jacobian matrix here denote the determinant of the matrix whose entry be a differential can be integrate over an orient manifold when the be define on an manifold with then the can be integrate over oriented submanifolds if integration over oriented submanifolds be just the summation of the integrand evaluate at point other value of correspond to line integral surface integral volume integral and so on there be several equivalent way to formally define the integral of a differential form all of which depend on reduce to the case of euclidean space on euclidean let be an open subset of give it standard orientation and the restriction of that orientation every smooth on have the form for some smooth function such a function have an integral in the usual riemann or lebesgue sense this allow u to define the integral of to be the integral of fix an orientation be necessary for this to be the of differential form mean that the integral of say must be the negative of the integral of riemann and lebesgue integral can not see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinate so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined the orientation resolve this ambiguity over let be an and an on first assume that there be a parametrization of by an open subset of euclidean space that be assume that there exist a diffeomorphism where give the orientation induce by then define the integral of over to be the integral of over in coordinate this have the following expression fix a chart on with coordinate then suppose that be define by then the integral may be write in coordinate a where be the determinant of the jacobian the jacobian exists because be differentiable in general an can not be parametrized by an open subset of but such a parametrization be always possible locally so it be possible to define integral over arbitrary manifold by define them a sum of integral over collection of local parametrizations moreover it be also possible to define parametrizations of subset for and this make it possible to define integral of to make this precise it be convenient to fix a standard domain in usually a cube or a simplex a be a formal sum of smooth embeddings that be it be a collection of smooth embeddings each of which be assign an integer multiplicity each smooth embed determines a submanifold of if the chain be then the integral of a over be define to be the sum of the integral over the term of this approach to define integration do not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold however it be still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly triangulate in an essentially unique way and the integral over may be define to be the integral over the chain determine by a triangulation use partition of there be another approach expound in which do directly assign a meaning to integration over but this approach require fix an orientation of the integral of an on an manifold be define by work in chart suppose first that be support on a single positively orient chart on this chart it may be pull back to an on an open subset of here the form have a riemann or lebesgue integral a before the change of variable formula and the assumption that the chart be positively orient together ensure that the integral of be independent of the chosen chart in the general case use a partition of unity to write a a sum of each of which be support in a single positively orient chart and define the integral of to be the sum of the integral of each term in the partition of unity it be also possible to integrate on oriented submanifolds use this more intrinsic approach the form be pull back to the submanifold where the integral be define use chart a before for example give a path integrate a on the path be simply pull back the form to a form on and this integral be the integral of the function on the interval along fubini theorem state that the integral over a set that be a product may be compute a an iterated integral over the two factor in the product this suggest that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable a an iterated integral as well the geometric flexibility of differential form ensure that this be possible not just for product but in more general situation a well under some hypothesis it be possible to integrate along the fiber of a smooth map and the analog of fubini theorem be the case where this map be the projection from a product to one of it factor because integrate a differential form over a submanifold require fix an orientation a prerequisite to integration along fiber be the existence of a orientation on those fiber let and be two orientable manifold of pure dimension and respectively suppose that be a surjective submersion this imply that each fiber be and that around each point of there be a chart on which look like the projection from a product onto one of it factor fix and set suppose that and that do not vanish follow there be a unique which may be think of a the fibral part of with respect to more precisely define to be the inclusion then be define by the property that where be any for which the form may also be notate moreover for fixed varies smoothly with respect to that be suppose that be a smooth section of the projection map we say that be a smooth differential on along then there be a smooth differential on such that at each this form be denote the same construction work if be an in a neighborhood of the fiber and the same notation be use a consequence be that each fiber be orientable in particular a choice of orientation form on and define an orientation of every fiber of the analog of fubini theorem be as follow a before and be two orientable manifold of pure dimension and and be a surjective submersion fix orientation of and and give each fiber of the induced orientation let be an on and let be an on that be almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of then for almost every the form be a integrable form on moreover there be an integrable on define by denote this form by then prove the generalized fubini formula it be also possible to integrate form of other degree along the fiber of a submersion assume the same hypothesis a before and let be a compactly support on then there be a on which be the result of integrate along the fiber of the form be define by specify at each how pair against each at and the value of that pairing be an integral over that depend only on and the orientation of and more precisely at each there be an isomorphism define by the interior product if then a at determines an at by pullback each of these covectors have an exterior product against so there be an on along define by this form depend on the orientation of but not the choice of then the be uniquely define by the property and be smooth this form also denote and call the of along the fiber of f integration along fiber be important for the construction of gysin map in de rham cohomology integration along fiber satisfy the formula if be any on then the fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration be give by the stokes theorem if be an with compact support on and denote the boundary of with it induced orientation then a key consequence of this be that the integral of a closed form over homologous chain be equal if be a closed and and be that be homologous such that be the boundary of a then since the difference be the integral for example if be the derivative of a potential function on the plane or then the integral of over a path from to do not depend on the choice of path the integral be since different path with give endpoint be homotopic hence homologous a weak condition this case be call the gradient theorem and generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus this path independence be very useful in contour integration this theorem also underlie the duality between de rham cohomology and the homology of chain relation with measure on a general differentiable manifold without additional structure differential form can not be integrate over subset of the manifold this distinction be key to the distinction between differential form which be integrate over chain or orient submanifolds and measure which be integrate over subset the simple example be attempt to integrate the over the interval assume the usual distance and thus measure on the real line this integral be either or depend on orientation while by contrast the integral of the measure on the interval be unambiguously formally the integral of the constant function with respect to this measure be similarly under a change of coordinate a differential change by the jacobian determinant while a measure change by the absolute value of the jacobian determinant which far reflect the issue of orientation for example under the map on the line the differential form pull back to orientation have reverse while the lebesgue measure which here we denote pull back to it do not change in the presence of the additional data of an orientation it be possible to integrate form over the entire manifold or over compact subset integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrate the form over the fundamental class of the manifold formally in the presence of an orientation one may identify with density on a manifold density in turn define a measure and thus can be integrate on an orientable but not orient manifold there be two choice of orientation either choice allow one to integrate over compact subset with the two choice differ by a sign on manifold and density can not be identify any form must vanish somewhere there be no volume form on manifold but there be thus while one can integrate density over compact subset one can not integrate one can instead identify density with pseudoforms even in the presence of an orientation there be in general no meaningful way to integrate over subset for because there be no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient subset geometrically a subset can be turn around in place yield the same subset with the opposite orientation for example the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotate by degree compare the gram determinant of a set of vector in an space which unlike the determinant of vector be always positive corresponding to a square number an orientation of a be therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold on a riemannian manifold one may define a hausdorff measure for any integer or real which may be integrate over subset of the manifold a function time this hausdorff measure can then be integrate over subset provide a analog to integration of the hausdorff measure yield a density a above the differential form analog of a distribution or generalize function be call a the space of on be the dual space to an appropriate space of differential current play the role of generalized domain of integration similar to but even more flexible than chain differential form arise in some important physical context for example in maxwell theory of electromagnetism the or electromagnetic field strength be where the be form from the electromagnetic field and or equivalent definition this form be a special case of the curvature form on the principal bundle on which both electromagnetism and general gauge theory may be describe the connection form for the principal bundle be the vector potential typically denote by when represent in some gauge one then have the be where be the four component of the current density here it be a matter of convention to write instead of to use capital letter and to write instead of however the vector rsp tensor component and the form have different physical dimension moreover by decision of an international commission of the international union of pure and applied physic the magnetic polarization vector be call since several decade and by some publisher the same name be use for different quantity use the definition maxwell equation can be write very compactly in geometrized unit a where denote the hodge star operator similar consideration describe the geometry of gauge theory in general the which be dual to the faraday form be also call electromagnetism be an example of a gauge theory here the lie group be the unitary group which be in particular abelian there be gauge theory such a theory in which the lie group be not abelian in that case one get relation which be similar to those describe here the analog of the field in such theory be the curvature form of the connection which be represent in a gauge by a lie the field be then define by in the abelian case such a

henri poincaré the group name after henri poincaré be first define by hermann minkowski a the group of minkowski spacetime isometry it be a lie group of fundamental importance in physic a minkowski spacetime isometry have the property that the interval between event be leave invariant for example if everything be postpone by two hour include the two event and the path you take to go from one to the other then the time interval between the event record by a you carry with you would be the same or if everything be shift five kilometre to the west or turn degree to the right you would also see no change in the interval it turn out that the proper length of an object be also unaffected by such a shift a time or space reversal a reflection be also an isometry of this group in minkowski space ignore the effect of gravity there be ten degree of freedom of the isometry which may be think of a translation through time or space four degree one per dimension reflection through a plane three degrees the freedom in orientation of this plane or a boost in any of the three spatial direction three degree composition of transformation be the operation of the poincaré group with proper rotation be produce a the composition of an even number of reflection in classical physic the galilean group be a comparable group that act on absolute time and space instead of boost it feature shear mapping to relate frame of reference poincaré symmetry be the full symmetry of special relativity it include translation displacement in time and space p form the abelian lie group of translation on rotation in space form the lie group of rotation j boost transformation connect two uniformly move body k the last two symmetry j and k together make the lorentz group see also lorentz invariance the product of the translation group and the lorentz group then produce the poincaré group object which be invariant under this group be then say to possess invariance or invariance the poincaré group be the group of minkowski spacetime isometry it be a noncompact lie group the abelian group of translation be a normal subgroup while the lorentz group be also a subgroup the stabilizer of the origin the poincaré group itself be the minimal subgroup of the affine group which include all translation and lorentz transformation more precisely it be a semidirect product of the translation and the lorentz group with group multiplication another way of put this be that the poincaré group be a group extension of the lorentz group by a vector representation of it it be sometimes dub informally a the lorentz group in turn it can also be obtain a a group contraction of the de sitter group so sp a the de sitter radius go to infinity it positive energy unitary irreducible representation be index by mass nonnegative number and spin integer or half integer and be associate with particle in quantum mechanic see wigner classification in accordance with the erlangen program the geometry of minkowski space be define by the poincaré group minkowski space be consider a a homogeneous space for the group in quantum field theory the universal cover of the poincaré group which may be identify with the double cover be more important because representation of be not able to describe field with spin fermion here be the group of complex matrix with unit determinant isomorphic to the spin group the algebra be the lie algebra of the poincaré group it be a lie algebra extension of the lie algebra of the lorentz group more specifically the proper det λ orthochronous part of the lorentz subgroup it identity component be connect to the identity and be thus provide by the exponentiation of this lie algebra in component form the poincaré algebra be give by the commutation relation where be the generator of translation be the generator of lorentz transformation and be the minkowski metric see sign convention the bottom commutation relation be the homogeneous lorentz group consist of rotation and boost in this notation the entire poincaré algebra be expressible in noncovariant but more practical language a where the bottom line commutator of two boost be often refer to a a wigner rotation the simplification which permit reduction of the lorentz subalgebra to and efficient treatment of it associated representation be important in term of the physical parameter we have the casimir invariant of this algebra be and where be the pseudovector they serve a label for the representation of the group the poincaré group be the full symmetry group of any relativistic field theory a a result all elementary particle fall in representation of this group these be usually specify by the square of each particle it mass square and the intrinsic quantum number where be the spin quantum number be the parity and be the quantum number in practice charge conjugation and parity be violate by many quantum field theory where this occurs and be forfeit since cpt symmetry be invariant in quantum field theory a quantum number may be construct from those give a a topological space the group have four connect component the component of the identity the time reverse component the spatial inversion component and the component which be both and spatially invert the definition above can be generalize to arbitrary dimension in a straightforward manner the poincaré group be analogously define by the product with the analogous multiplication the lie algebra retain it form with index and now take value between and the alternative representation in term of and have no analogue in high dimension a related observation be that the representation of the lorentz group include a pair of inequivalent complex spinor representation and whose tensor product be the adjoint representation one may identify this last bit with minkowski space itself a oppose to identify it with a particle a would normally be do for a pair of fermion a pion be compose of a pair this strongly suggest that it might be possible to extend the poincaré algebra to also include spinors this lead directly to the notion of the algebra the mathematical appeal of this idea be that one be work with the fundamental representation instead of the adjoint representations the physical appeal of this idea be that the fundamental representation correspond to fermion which be see in nature so far however the implied supersymmetry here of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic direction can not be see experimentally in nature the experimental issue can roughly be state a the question if we live in the adjoint representation minkowski spacetime then where be the fundamental representation hide euclidean group representation theory of the poincaré group wigner classification symmetry in quantum mechanic

the program be a method of characterize geometry base on group theory and projective geometry it be publish by felix klein in a vergleichende betrachtungen über neuere geometrische forschungen it be name after the university where klein work by geometry have emerge but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationship klein method be fundamentally innovative in three way projective geometry be emphasize a the unifying frame for all other geometry consider by him in particular euclidean geometry be more restrictive than affine geometry which in turn be more restrictive than projective geometry klein propose that group theory a branch of mathematics that use algebraic method to abstract the idea of symmetry be the most useful way of organize geometrical knowledge at the time it have already be introduce into the theory of equation in the form of galois theory klein make much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language have it own appropriate concept thus for example projective geometry rightly talk about conic section but not about circle or angle because those notion be not invariant under projective transformation something familiar in geometrical perspective the way the multiple language of geometry then come back together could be explain by the way subgroup of a symmetry group relate to each other later élie cartan generalize klein homogeneous model space to cartan connection on certain principal bundle which generalize riemannian geometry since euclid geometry have mean the geometry of euclidean space of two dimension plane geometry or of three dimension solid geometry in the first half of the nineteenth century there have be several development complicate the picture mathematical application require geometry of four or more dimension the close scrutiny of the foundation of the traditional euclidean geometry have reveal the independence of the parallel postulate from the others and geometry have be bear klein propose an idea that all these new geometry be just special case of the projective geometry a already develop by poncelet möbius cayley and others klein also strongly suggest to mathematical physicist that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefit to them with every geometry klein associate an underlie group of symmetry the hierarchy of geometry be thus mathematically represent a a hierarchy of these group and hierarchy of their invariant for example length angle and area be preserve with respect to the euclidean group of symmetry while only the incidence structure and the be preserve under the most general projective transformation a concept of parallelism which be preserve in affine geometry be not meaningful in projective geometry then by abstract the underlie group of symmetry from the geometry the relationship between them can be at the group level since the group of affine geometry be a subgroup of the group of projective geometry any notion invariant in projective geometry be a priori meaningful in affine geometry but not the other way round if you remove require symmetry you have a more powerful theory but few concept and theorem which will be deep and more general in other word the traditional space be homogeneous space but not for a uniquely determine group change the group change the appropriate geometric language in today language the group concern in classical geometry be all very well know a lie group the classical group the specific relationship be quite simply described use technical language for example the group of projective geometry in n dimension be the symmetry group of n real projective space the general linear group of degree quotiented by scalar matrix the affine group will be the subgroup respect mapping to itself not fix pointwise the chosen hyperplane at infinity this subgroup have a know structure semidirect product of the general linear group of degree n with the subgroup of translation this description then tell u which property be in euclidean plane geometry term be a parallelogram be affine since affine transformation always take one parallelogram to another one be a circle be not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse to explain accurately the relationship between affine and euclidean geometry we now need to pin down the group of euclidean geometry within the affine group the euclidean group be in fact use the previous description of the affine group the product of the orthogonal rotation and reflection group with the translation see klein geometry for more detail the effect of the erlangen program can be see all over pure mathematics see tacit use at congruence geometry for example and the idea of transformation and of synthesis use group of symmetry have become standard in physic when topology be routinely describe in term of property invariant under homeomorphism one can see the underlie idea in operation the group involve will be in almost all case and not lie group but the philosophy be the same of course this mostly speak to the pedagogical influence of klein book such a those by coxeter routinely use the erlangen program approach to help geometry in pedagogic term the program become transformation geometry a mixed blessing in the sense that it build on strong intuition than the style of euclid but be less easily convert into a logical system in his book structuralism jean piaget say in the eye of contemporary structuralist mathematician like bourbaki the erlangen program amount to only a partial victory for structuralism since they want to subordinate all mathematics not just geometry to the idea of structure for a geometry and it group an element of the group be sometimes call a motion of the geometry for example one can learn about the poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry through a development base on hyperbolic motion such a development enable one to methodically prove the ultraparallel theorem by successive motion quite often it appear there be two or more distinct geometry with isomorphic automorphism group there arise the question of read the erlangen program from the abstract group to the geometry one example orient reflection not include elliptic geometry the surface of an n with opposite point identify and orient spherical geometry the same geometry but with opposite point not identify have isomorphic automorphism group so n for even n these may appear to be distinct it turn out however that the geometry be very closely relate in a way that can be make precise to take another example elliptic geometry with different radius of curvature have isomorphic automorphism group that do not really count a a critique a all such geometry be isomorphic general riemannian geometry fall outside the boundary of the program complex dual and double aka number appear a homogeneous space sl r for the group sl r and it subgroup n k the group sl r act on these homogeneous space by linear fractional transformation and a large portion of the respective geometry can be obtain in a uniform way from the erlangen programme some further notable example have come up in physic firstly n hyperbolic geometry n de sitter space and n inversive geometry all have isomorphic automorphism group the orthochronous lorentz group for but these be apparently distinct geometry here some interesting result enter from the physic it have be show that physic model in each of the three geometry be dual for some model again n sitter space and n conformal space with lorentzian signature in contrast with conformal space with euclidean signature which be identical to inversive geometry for three dimension or great have isomorphic automorphism group but be distinct geometry once again there be model in physic with duality between both space see for more detail the cover group of su be isomorphic to the cover group of so which be the symmetry group of a conformal minkowski space and a sitter space and a complex twistor space the erlangen program can therefore still be consider fertile in relation with duality in physic in the seminal paper which introduce category saunders mac lane and eilenberg state this may be regard a a continuation of the klein erlanger program in the sense that a geometrical space with it group of transformation be generalize to a category with it algebra of mapping relation of the erlangen program with work of ehresmann on groupoids in geometry be consider in the article below by pradines in mathematical logic the erlangen

eukaryotic messenger rna synthesis of protein by a ribosome initiation and elongation stage of translation a see through zoom in on the nitrogenous base in rna the ribosome the trna and amino acid with short explanation in molecular biology and genetics be the process in which ribosome in the cytoplasm or er synthesize protein after the process of transcription of dna to rna in the cell nucleus the entire process be call gene expression in translation messenger rna mrna be decode in the ribosome decode center to produce a specific amino acid chain or polypeptide the polypeptide later fold into an active protein and perform it function in the cell the ribosome facilitates decode by induce the binding of complementary trna anticodon sequence to mrna codon the trna carry specific amino acid that be chain together into a polypeptide a the mrna pass through and be read by the ribosome translation proceeds in three phase the ribosome assemble around the target mrna the first trna be attach at the start codon the trna transfer an amino acid to the trna correspond to the next codon the ribosome then move translocates to the next mrna codon to continue the process create an amino acid chain when a peptidyl trna encounter a stop codon then the ribosome fold the polypeptide into it final structure the three phase of translation initiation polymerase bind to the dna strand and move along until the small ribosomal subunit bind to the dna elongation be initiate when the large subunit attache and termination end the process of elongation in prokaryote unicellular translation occur in the cytosol where the medium and small subunit of the ribosome bind to the trna in eukaryote translation occur in the cytosol or across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process call translocation in translocation the entire complex bind to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum er and the new protein be synthesize and release into the er the newly create polypeptide can be store inside the er for future vesicle transport and secretion outside the cell or immediately secrete many type of transcribed rna such a transfer rna ribosomal rna and small nuclear rna do not undergo translation into proteins a number of antibiotic act by inhibit translation these include clindamycin anisomycin cycloheximide chloramphenicol tetracycline streptomycin erythromycin and puromycin prokaryotic ribosome have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosome and thus antibiotic can specifically target bacterial infection without any harm to a eukaryotic host cell in zamecnik and hoagland discover trna in george palade discover ribosomes a ribosome translate a protein that be secrete into the endoplasmic reticulum trna be color dark blue the basic process of translation be the addition of one amino acid at a time to the end of the polypeptide be form this process take place inside the ribosome a ribosome be make up of a subunit a small subunit or a large subunit these subunit come together before translation of mrna into a protein to provide a location for translation to be carry out and a polypeptide to be produce the choice of amino acid type to be add be determine by the genetic code on the mrna molecule each amino acid add be match to a three nucleotide subsequence of the mrna for each such triplet possible the corresponding amino acid be accept the successive amino acid add to the chain be match to successive nucleotide triplet in the mrna in this way the sequence of nucleotide in the template mrna chain determine the sequence of amino acid in the generated polypeptide addition of an amino acid occur at the of the peptide and thus translation be say to be direct the mrna carry genetic information encode a a dna sequence from the chromosome to the nucleolus the ribonucleotides be read by translational machinery in a sequence of nucleotide triplet call codon each of those triplet cod for a specific amino acid the ribosome translate this code to a specific sequence of amino acid the ribosome be a structure contain rrna and proteins it be the factory where amino acid be assemble into protein trna be small noncoding rna chain nucleotide that transport amino acid to the ribosome trna have a site for amino acid attachment and a site call an anticodon the anticodon be an rna triplet complementary to the mrna triplet that cod for their cargo amino acid aminoacyl trna synthetases enzymes catalyze the bonding between specific trna and the amino acid that their anticodon sequence call for the product of this reaction be an in prokaryote this be carry to the ribosome by where mrna codon be match through complementary base pairing to specific trna anticodons synthetases that mispair trna with the wrong amino acid can produce mischarged which can result in inappropriate amino acid at the respective position in protein this mistranslation of the genetic code naturally occur at low level in most organism but certain cellular environment cause an increase in permissive mrna decode sometimes to the benefit of the cell the ribosome have three site for trna to bind they be the aminoacyl site abbreviate a the peptidyl site abbreviate p and the exit site abbreviate e with respect to the mrna the three site be orient to because ribosome move toward the end of mrna the bind the incoming trna with the complementary codon on the mrna the hold the trna with the grow polypeptide chain the hold the trna without it amino acid and the trna be then release when an initially bind to it correspond codon on the mrna it be in the a site then a peptide bond form between the amino acid of the trna in the a site and the amino acid of the charge trna in the p site the grow polypeptide chain be transfer to the trna in the a site translocation occur move the trna in the p site now without an amino acid to the e site the trna that be in the a site now charge with the polypeptide chain be move to the p site the trna in the e site leaf and another enter the a site to repeat the process after the new amino acid be add to the chain and after the mrna be release out of the nucleus and into the ribosome core the energy provide by the hydrolysis of an atp bound to the translocase in prokaryote and in eukaryote move the ribosome down one codon towards the end the energy require for translation of protein be significant for a protein contain n amino acids the number of phosphate bond require to translate it be n the rate of translation varies it be significantly high in prokaryotic cell up to amino acid residue per second than in eukaryotic cell up to amino acid residue per second even though the ribosome be usually consider accurate processive machine the translation process be subject to error that can lead either to the synthesis of erroneous protein or to the premature abandonment of translation the rate of error in synthesize protein have be estimate to be between and misincorporated amino acid depend on the experimental condition the rate of premature translation abandonment instead have be estimate to be of the order of magnitude of event per translate codon the correct amino acid be covalently bond to the correct transfer rna trna by amino acyl transferases the amino acid be join by it carboxyl group to the oh of the trna by an ester bond when the trna have an amino acid link to it the trna be term charged initiation involve the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the end of mrna with the help of initiation factor if in prokaryote initiation of protein synthesis involve the recognition of a initiation sequence on the mrna call the sequence the sequence bind to a complementary sequence on the end of the rrna part of the ribosomal subunit the binding of these complementary sequence ensure that the ribosomal subunit be bind to the mrna and be align such that the initiation codon be place in the portion of the once the mrna and subunit be properly bound an initiation factor bring the initiator acid complex to the p site the initiation phase be complete once a subunit join the subunit form an active ribosome termination of the polypeptide occur when the a site of the ribosome be occupy by a stop codon uaa uag or uga on the mrna trna usually can not recognize or bind to stop codon instead the stop codon induce the binding of a release factor protein that prompt the disassembly of the entire complex by the hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain from the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome drug or special sequence motif on the mrna can change the ribosomal structure so that trna be bind to the stop codon instead of the release factor in such case of readthrough translation continue until the ribosome encounter the next stop codon the process of translation be highly regulate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organism regulation of translation can impact the global rate of protein synthesis which be closely couple to the metabolic and proliferative state of a cell in addition recent work have reveal that genetic difference and their subsequent expression a mrna can also impact translation rate in an manner figure basic and the simple model of protein synthesis here amount of mrna with translation initiation site not occupy by assemble ribosome amount of mrna with translation initiation site occupy by assemble ribosome amount of ribosome sit on mrna synthesize protein amount of synthesized protein figure the extended model of protein synthesis with explicit presentation of and initiation factor if bind the process description mention only the most basic process consist of production of mrna molecule include splice initiation of these molecule with help of initiation factor the initiation can include the circularization step though it be not universally required initiation of translation recruit the small ribosomal subunit assembly of full ribosome elongation movement of ribosome along mrna with production of protein termination of translation degradation of mrna molecule degradation of protein the process of protein synthesis and translation be a subject of mathematical modeling for a long time start from the first detailed kinetic model such a or others take into account stochastic aspect of translation and use computer simulation many chemical model of protein synthesis have be develop and analyze in the last four decade beyond chemical kinetics various model formalism such a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process tasep probabilistic boolean network pbn petri net and algebra have be apply to model the detailed kinetics of protein synthesis or some of it stage a basic model of protein synthesis that take into account all eight process have be develop follow the paradigm that useful model be simple and extendable the simple model be represent by the reaction kinetic mechanism figure it be generalise to include and initiation factor if binding figure it be extend far to include effect of microrna on protein synthesis most of model in this hierarchy can be solve analytically these solution be use to extract signature of different specific mechanism of synthesis regulation whereas other aspect such a the structure call tertiary structure of protein can only be predict use sophisticated algorithm the amino acid sequence call primary structure can be determine solely from the nucleic acid sequence with the aid of a translation table this approach may not give the correct amino acid composition of the protein in particular if unconventional amino acid such a selenocysteine be incorporate into the protein which be cod for by a conventional stop codon in combination with a downstream hairpin selenocysteine insertion sequence or secis there be many computer program capable of translate a sequence into a protein sequence normally this be perform use the standard genetic code however few program can handle all the special case such a the use of the alternative initiation codon for instance the rare alternative start codon ctg code for methionine when use a a start codon and for

equilibrium perfectly or almost perfectly balanced microscopic exchange occur this be the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium a thermodynamic system in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium have a spatially uniform temperature it intensive property other than temperature may be drive to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging force field impose on it by it surroundings in system that be at a state of there be by contrast net flow of matter or energy if such change can be trigger to occur in a system in which they be not already occur the system be say to be in a equilibrium though not a widely name a law it be an axiom of thermodynamics that there exist state of thermodynamic equilibrium the second law of thermodynamics state that when a body of material start from an equilibrium state in which portion of it be hold at different state by more or less permeable or impermeable partition and a thermodynamic operation remove or make the partition more permeable and it be isolate then it spontaneously reach it own new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium and this be accompany by an increase in the sum of the entropy of the portion classical thermodynamics deal with state of dynamic equilibrium the state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium be the one for which some thermodynamic potential be minimize or for which the entropy s be maximize for specified condition one such potential be the helmholtz free energy a for a system with surroundings at control constant temperature and volume another potential the gibbs free energy g be minimize at thermodynamic equilibrium in a system with surroundings at control constant temperature and pressure where t denote the absolute thermodynamic temperature p the pressure s the entropy v the volume and u the internal energy of the system thermodynamic equilibrium be the unique stable stationary state that be approach or eventually reach a the system interact with it surroundings over a long time the potential be mathematically construct to be the thermodynamic quantity that be minimize under the particular condition in the specified surroundings for a completely isolated system s be maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium for a system with controlled constant temperature and volume a be minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium for a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure g be minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium the various type of equilibrium be achieve a follow system be in thermal equilibrium when their temperature be the same system be in mechanical equilibrium when their pressure be the same system be in diffusive equilibrium when their chemical potential be the same force be balance and there be no significant external driving force often the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regard a another thermodynamic system in this view one may consider the system and it surroundings a two system in mutual contact with force also link them the enclosure of the system be the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two system in the thermodynamic formalism that surface be regard a have specific property of permeability for example the surface of contiguity may be suppose to be permeable only to heat allow energy to transfer only as heat then the two system be say to be in thermal equilibrium when the force be unchanging in time and the transfer of energy a heat between them have slow and eventually stop permanently this be an example of a contact equilibrium other kind of contact equilibrium be define by other kind of specific permeability when two system be in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability they have common value of the intensive variable that belong to that particular kind of permeability example of such intensive variable be temperature pressure chemical potential a contact equilibrium may be regard also a an exchange equilibrium there be a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two system in contact equilibrium for example for a wall permeable only to heat the rate of diffusion of internal energy a heat between the two system be equal and opposite an adiabatic wall between the two system be only to energy transfer a work at mechanical equilibrium the rate of transfer of energy a work between them be equal and opposite if the wall be a simple wall then the rate of transfer of volume across it be also equal and opposite and the pressure on either side of it be equal if the adiabatic wall be more complicated with a sort of leverage have an then the pressure of the two system in exchange equilibrium be in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio this keep the zero balance of rate of transfer a work a radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate system radiative exchange equilibrium prevail when the two system have the same temperature a collection of matter may be entirely isolate from it surroundings if it have be leave undisturbed for an indefinitely long time classical thermodynamics postulate that it be in a state in which no change occur within it and there be no flow within it this be a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium this postulate be sometimes but not often call the minus first law of thermodynamics one textbook call it the zeroth law remark that the author think this more befitting that title than it more customary definition which apparently be suggest by fowler such state be a principal concern in what be know a classical or equilibrium thermodynamics for they be the only state of the system that be regard as well define in that subject a system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a thermodynamic operation be isolate and upon the event of isolation no change occur in it a system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regard a be in it own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium the thermodynamic formalism allow that a system may have contact with several other system at once which may or may not also have mutual contact the contact have respectively different permeability if these system be all jointly isolate from the rest of the world those of them that be in contact then reach respective contact equilibrium with one another if several system be free of adiabatic wall between each other but be jointly isolate from the rest of the world then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium and they have a common temperature a total internal energy and a total entropy amongst intensive variable this be a unique property of temperature it hold even in the presence of force that be there be no force that can maintain temperature discrepancy for example in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field the pressure on the top wall be less than that on the bottom wall but the temperature be the same everywhere a thermodynamic operation may occur a an event restrict to the wall that be within the surroundings directly affect neither the wall of contact of the system of interest with it surroundings nor it interior and occur within a definitely limited time for example an immovable adiabatic wall may be place or remove within the surroundings consequent upon such an operation restrict to the surroundings the system may be for a time drive away from it own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium then accord to the second law of thermodynamics the whole undergoes change and eventually reach a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings follow planck this consequent train of event be call a natural thermodynamic process it be allow in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final state be of thermodynamic equilibrium even though during the process there be transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium when neither the system nor it surroundings be in well define state of internal equilibrium a natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of it course it be thereby radically different from a fictive that proceed infinitely slowly throughout it course and be fictively classical thermodynamics allow that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium if the main part of it course be at a finite rate then it be consider to be natural and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics and thereby irreversible engineer machine and artificial device and manipulation be permit within the surroundings the allowance of such operation and device in the surroundings but not in the system be the reason why kelvin in one of his statement of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of inanimate agency a system in thermodynamic equilibrium be inanimate otherwise a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system it be often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystem be so much large than the system that the process can affect the intensive variable only of the surround subsystem and they be then call reservoir for relevant intensive variable it be useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium in thermodynamics exchange within a system and between the system and the outside be control by intensive parameter a an example temperature control heat exchange thermodynamic equilibrium gte mean that those intensive parameter be homogeneous throughout the whole system while local thermodynamic equilibrium lte mean that those intensive parameter be vary in space and time but be vary so slowly that for any point one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point if the description of the system require variation in the intensive parameter that be too large the very assumption upon which the definition of these intensive parameter be base will break down and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium for example it take a certain number of collision for a particle to equilibrate to it surroundings if the average distance it have move during these collision remove it from the neighborhood it be equilibrate to it will never equilibrate and there will be no lte temperature be by definition proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrate neighborhood since there be no equilibrated neighborhood the concept of temperature do hold and the temperature become undefined it be important to note that this local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particle in the system for example lte be usually apply only to massive particle in a radiating gas the photon be emit and absorb by the gas do need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particle of the gas in order for lte to exist in some case it be not consider necessary for free electron to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atom or molecule for lte to exist a an example lte will exist in a glass of water that contain a melting ice cube the temperature inside the glass can be define at any point but it be colder near the ice cube than far away from it if energy of the molecule locate near a give point be observe they will be distribute accord to the distribution for a certain temperature if the energy of the molecule locate near another point be observe they will be distribute accord to the distribution for another temperature local thermodynamic equilibrium do not require either local or global stationarity in other word each small locality need not have a constant temperature however it do require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain it local distribution of molecular velocity a global state can be stably stationary only if it be maintain by exchange between the system and the outside for example a stationary state could be maintain inside the glass of water by continuously add finely powder ice into it in order to compensate for the melting and continuously drain off the meltwater natural transport phenomenon may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium go back to our example the diffusion of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium a state in which the temperature of the glass be completely homogeneous careful and well informed writer about thermodynamics in their account of thermodynamic equilibrium often enough make proviso or reservation to their statement some writer leave such reservation merely imply or more or less unstated for example one widely cite writer callen write in this context in actuality few system be in absolute and true equilibrium he refer to radioactive process and remark that they may take cosmic time to complete and generally can be ignore he add in practice the criterion for equilibrium be circular a system be in an equilibrium state if it property be consistently describe by thermodynamic theory beattie and oppenheim write insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all state of real system another author cite by callen a give a scholarly and rigorous treatment and cite by adkins a have write a classic text pippard write in that text give long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense the time involve may be so enormous however perhaps year or more for most purpose provide the rapid change be not artificially stimulate the system may be regard a be in equilibrium another author münster write in this context he observe that thermonuclear process often occur so slowly that they can be ignore in thermodynamics he comment the concept equilibrium or with respect to all imaginable process have therefore no physical significance he therefore state that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specify process and define experimental condition accord to tisza in the discussion of phenomenon near absolute zero the absolute prediction of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of nonequilibrium state be very common the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system be through contact with the surroundings that allow simultaneous passage of all chemical substance and all kind of energy a system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change it shape or size while do so thus it be define by a rigid volume in space it may lie within external field of force determine by external factor of far great extent than the system itself so that event within the system can not in an appreciable amount affect the external field of force the system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force field be uniform and be determine it uniform acceleration or if it lie in a force field but be hold stationary there by local force such a mechanical pressure on it surface thermodynamic equilibrium be a primitive notion of the theory of thermodynamics accord to morse it should be emphasize that the fact that there be thermodynamic state and the fact that there be thermodynamic variable which be uniquely specify by the equilibrium state be not conclusion deduce logically from some philosophical first principle they be conclusion ineluctably draw from more than two century of experiment this mean that thermodynamic equilibrium be not to be define solely in term of other theoretical concept of thermodynamics bailyn propose a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulate the existence of state of thermodynamic equilibrium textbook definition of thermodynamic equilibrium be often state carefully with some reservation or other for example münster write an isolated system be in thermodynamic equilibrium when in the system no change of state be occur at a measurable rate there be two reservation state here the system be isolate any change of state be immeasurably slow he discuss the second proviso by give an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst münster point out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state be describe by few macroscopic variable than be any other state of a give system this be partly but not entirely because all flow within and through the system be zero haase presentation of thermodynamics do not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intend to allow for thermodynamics he consider an arbitrary system with time invariant property he test it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cut it off from all external influence except external force field if after insulation nothing change he say that the system be in equilibrium in a section head thermodynamic equilibrium callen defines equilibrium state in a paragraph he point out that they be determine by intrinsic factor within the system they be terminal state towards which the system evolve over time which may occur with glacial slowness this statement do not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium the system must be isolate callen do not spell out what he mean by the word intrinsic factor another textbook writer adkins explicitly allow thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which be not isolate his system be however close with respect to transfer of matter he write in general the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and interaction with the surroundings he distinguish such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium in which only thermal contact be mediate transfer of energy another textbook author partington write i an equilibrium state be one which be independent of time but refer to system which be only apparently in equilibrium he add such system be in state of partington statement do not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system like münster partington also refer to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen he add a proviso that in a true equilibrium state the small change of any external condition which influence the state will produce a small change of state this proviso mean that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbation this requirement be essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium a student textbook by crawford have a section head thermodynamic equilibrium it distinguish several driver of flow and then say these be example of the apparently universal tendency of isolated system toward a state of complete mechanical thermal chemical and in a single word a monograph on classical thermodynamics by buchdahl considers the equilibrium of a thermodynamic system without actually write the phrase thermodynamic equilibrium refer to system close to exchange of matter buchdahl write if a system be in a terminal condition which be properly static it will be say to be in equilibrium buchdahl monograph also discuss amorphous glass for the purpose of thermodynamic description it state more precisely the glass may be regard a be in equilibrium so long a experimental test show that transition be in effect reversible it be not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium but the converse be usually assume that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium be subject to a sufficiently slow process that process may be consider to be sufficiently nearly reversible and the body remain sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process münster carefully extend his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated system by introduce a concept of contact equilibrium this specify particular process that be allow when consider thermodynamic equilibrium for system with special concern for open system which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings a contact equilibrium be between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings bring into contact with the system of interest the contact be through a special kind of wall for the rest the whole joint system be isolated wall of this special kind be also consider by carathéodory and be mention by other writer also they be selectively permeable they may be permeable only to mechanical work or only to heat or only to some particular chemical substance each contact equilibrium define an intensive parameter for example a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature a contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest in a contact equilibrium despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall the system of interest be changeless a if it be in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium this scheme follow the general rule that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specify process and define experimental condition thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system mean that with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall contact equilibrium exist when the respective intensive parameter of the system and surroundings be equal this definition do not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium which be through unselective contact this definition do not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundary but it be compatible with the follow definition which do so state zemansky also distinguish mechanical chemical and thermal equilibrium he then write when the condition for all three type of equilibrium be satisfy the system be say to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium morse write that thermodynamics be concern with of thermodynamic equilibrium he also use the phrase thermal equilibrium while discuss transfer of energy a heat between a body and a heat reservoir in it surroundings though not explicitly define a special term equilibrium waldram writes of a definite thermodynamic state he define the term thermal equilibrium for a system when it observables have cease to change over time but shortly below that definition he write of a piece of glass that have not yet reach it thermodynamic equilibrium state consider equilibrium state bailyn write each intensive variable have it own type of equilibrium he then define thermal equilibrium mechanical equilibrium and material equilibrium accordingly he write if all the intensive variable become uniform thermodynamic equilibrium be say to exist he be not here consider the presence of an external force field kirkwood and oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium a follow a system be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium if during the time period allot for experimentation a it intensive property be independent of time and b no current of matter or energy exists in it interior or at it boundary with the surroundings it be evident that they be not restrict the definition to isolate or to close system they do not discuss the possibility of change that occur with glacial slowness and proceed beyond the time period allot for experimentation they note that for two system in contact there exist a small subclass of intensive property such that if all those of that small subclass be respectively equal then all respective intensive property be equal state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be define by this subclass provide some other condition be satisfy in the absence of external a thermodynamic system consist of a single phase in the absence of external force in it own internal thermodynamic equilibrium be homogeneous this mean that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchange with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system and the effect be to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged in general a strong external force field make a system of a single phase in it own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some intensive variable for example a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrate by centrifugation such equilibrium inhomogeneity induce by external force do not occur for the intensive variable temperature accord to guggenheim the most important conception of thermodynamics be temperature planck introduce his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium and then announces in the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous isotropic body of any form possess throughout their substance the same temperature and density and subject to a uniform pressure act everywhere perpendicular to the surface a do carathéodory planck be set aside surface effect and external field and anisotropic crystal though refer to temperature planck do not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium in contrast carathéodory scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed system postulate the concept of an equilibrium state follow gibbs gibbs speak routinely of a thermodynamic state though not explicitly use the phrase equilibrium nor explicitly postulate the existence of a temperature to define it the temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium be uniform in space as well a in time in a system in it own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium there be no net internal macroscopic flow in particular this mean that all local part of the system be in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium this mean that the temperature of the system be spatially uniform this be so in all case include those of external force field for an externally impose gravitational field this may be prove in macroscopic thermodynamic term by the calculus of variation use the method of langrangian multiplier consideration of kinetic theory or statistical mechanic also support this statement in order that a system may be in it own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium it be of course necessary but not sufficient that it be in it own internal state of thermal equilibrium it be possible for a system to reach internal mechanical equilibrium before it reach internal thermal equilibrium of real variable need for in his exposition of his scheme of closed system equilibrium thermodynamics carathéodory initially postulate that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variable define the state that be the point of the manifold of equilibrium in the word of prigogine and defay it be a matter of experience that when we have specify a certain number of macroscopic property of a system then all the other property be fix a note above accord to münster the number of variable need to define a thermodynamic equilibrium be the least for any state of a give isolated system a note above kirkwood and oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be define by a special subclass of intensive variable with a definite number of member in that subclass if the thermodynamic equilibrium lie in an external force field it be only the temperature that can in general be expect to be spatially uniform intensive variable other than temperature will in general be if the external force field be in such a case in general additional variable be need to describe the spatial against small a note above partington point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium be stable against small transient perturbation without this condition in general experiment intend to study system in thermodynamic equilibrium be in severe difficulty to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated when a body of material start from a state of inhomogeneity or chemical and be then isolate it spontaneously evolve towards it own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium it be not necessary that all aspect of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reach simultaneously some can be establish before others for example in many case of such evolution internal mechanical equilibrium be establish much more rapidly than the other aspect of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium another example be that in many case of such evolution thermal equilibrium be reach much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium within an isolated system in it own internal thermodynamic in an isolated system thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time in classical physic it be often convenient to ignore the effect of measurement and this be assume in the present account to consider the notion of fluctuation in an isolated thermodynamic system a convenient example be a system specify by it extensive state variable internal energy volume and mass composition by definition they be by definition they combine with nominal value of their conjugate intensive function of state inverse temperature pressure divide by temperature and the chemical potential divide by temperature so a to exactly obey the law of thermodynamics but the law of thermodynamics combine with the value of the specify extensive variable of state be not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal value further information be need namely of the constitutive property of the system it may be admit that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive function of state they be find to have slightly different value from time to time such variability be regard a due to internal fluctuation the different measured value average to their nominal value if the system be truly macroscopic a postulate by classical thermodynamics then the fluctuation be too small to detect macroscopically this be call the thermodynamic limit in effect the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanish from sight too small to see accord to buchdahl there be no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuation about equilibrium see however section if the system be repeatedly subdivide eventually a system be produce that be small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuation this be a mesoscopic level of investigation the fluctuation be then directly dependent on the nature of the various wall of the system the precise choice of independent state variable be then important at this stage statistical feature of the law of thermodynamics become apparent if the mesoscopic system be far repeatedly divide eventually a microscopic system be produce then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the process of fluctuation one have leave the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics and one need quantum statistical mechanic the fluctuation can become relatively dominant and question of measurement become important the statement that system be it own internal thermodynamic equilibrium may be take to mean that many such measurement have be take from time to time with no trend in time in the various measured value thus the statement that system be in it own internal thermodynamic equilibrium with stated nominal value of it function of state conjugate to it specify state variable be far far more informative than a statement that set of single simultaneous measurement of those function of state have those same value this be because the single measurement might have be make during a slight fluctuation away from another set of nominal value of those conjugate intensive function of state that be due to unknown and different constitutive property a single measurement can not tell whether that might be so unless there be also knowledge of the nominal value that belong to the equilibrium state thermal equilibrium an explicit distinction between equilibrium and equilibrium be make by eu he consider two system in thermal contact one a thermometer the other a system in which there be occur several irreversible process entail flux the two system be separate by a wall permeable only to heat he consider the case in which over the time scale of interest it happen that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible process be steady then there be thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium eu propose consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be consider to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium be not present also he propose that if change be occur so fast that a steady temperature can not be define then it be no longer possible to describe the process by mean of a thermodynamic formalism in other word thermodynamics have no mean for such a process this illustrate the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature thermal equilibrium be achieve when two system in thermal contact with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy it follow that if two system be in thermal equilibrium then their temperature be the same thermal equilibrium occur when a system macroscopic thermal observables have cease to change with time for example an ideal gas whose distribution function have stabilise to a specific distribution would be in thermal equilibrium this outcome allow a single temperature and pressure to be attribute to the whole system for an isolated body it be quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reach before thermal equilibrium be reach but eventually all aspect of equilibrium include thermal equilibrium be necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium a system internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguish from a stationary state in which thermodynamic parameter be unchanging in time but the system be not isolate so that there be into and out of the system macroscopic flux which be constant in time thermodynamics be a branch of thermodynamics that deal with system that be not in thermodynamic equilibrium most system find in nature be not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they be change or can be trigger to change over time and be continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other system the thermodynamic study of system require more general concept than be deal with by equilibrium thermodynamics many natural system still today remain beyond the scope of currently know macroscopic thermodynamic method law govern system which be far from equilibrium be also debatable one of the guiding principle for these system be the maximum entropy production principle it state that a system

yakir aharonov david bohm the effect sometimes call the effect be a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which an electrically charge particle be affect by an electromagnetic potential φ despite be confine to a region in which both the magnetic field and electric field be zero the underlie mechanism be the coupling of the electromagnetic potential with the complex phase of a charged particle wave function and the effect be accordingly illustrate by interference experiment the most commonly described case sometimes call the solenoid effect take place when the wave function of a charged particle pass around a long solenoid experience a phase shift a a result of the enclosed magnetic field despite the magnetic field be negligible in the region through which the particle pass and the particle wavefunction be negligible inside the solenoid this phase shift have be observe experimentally there be also magnetic effect on bound energy and scatter cross section but these case have not be experimentally test an electric phenomenon be also predict in which a charged particle be affect by region with different electrical potential but zero electric field but this have no experimental confirmation yet a separate molecular effect be propose for nuclear motion in multiply connect region but this have be argue to be a different kind of geometric phase a it be neither nonlocal nor topological depend only on local quantity along the nuclear path werner ehrenberg and raymond siday first predict the effect in yakir aharonov and david bohm publish their analysis in after publication of the paper bohm be inform of ehrenberg and siday work which be acknowledge and credit in bohm and aharonov subsequent paper the effect be confirm experimentally with a very large error while bohm be still alive by the time the error be down to a respectable value bohm have die in the and century physic be dominate by newtonian dynamic with it emphasis on force electromagnetic phenomenon be elucidate by a series of experiment involve the measurement of force between charge current and magnet in various configuration eventually a description arose accord to which charge current and magnet act a local source of propagate force field which then act on other charge and current locally through the lorentz force law in this framework because one of the observed property of the electric field be that it be irrotational and one of the observed property of the magnetic field be that it be divergenceless it be possible to express an electrostatic field a the gradient of a scalar potential coulomb electrostatic potential which be mathematically analogous to the classical gravitational potential and a stationary magnetic field a the curl of a vector potential then a new concept the idea of a scalar potential be already well accept by analogy with gravitational potential the language of potential generalise seamlessly to the fully dynamic case but since all physical effect be describable in term of the field which be the derivative of the potential potential unlike field be not uniquely determine by physical effect potential be only define up to an arbitrary additive constant electrostatic potential and an irrotational stationary magnetic vector potential the effect be important conceptually because it bear on three issue apparent in the recasting of maxwell classical electromagnetic theory a a gauge theory which before the advent of quantum mechanic could be argue to be a mathematical reformulation with no physical consequence the thought experiment and their experimental realization imply that the issue be not just philosophical the three issue be whether potential be physical or just a convenient tool for calculate force field whether action principle be fundamental the principle of locality because of reason like these the effect be choose by the new scientist magazine a one of the seven wonder of the quantum world potential field it be generally argue that effect illustrate the physicality of electromagnetic potential φ and in quantum mechanic classically it be possible to argue that only the electromagnetic field be physical while the electromagnetic potential be purely mathematical construct that due to gauge freedom be even unique for a give electromagnetic field however vaidman have challenge this interpretation by show that the ab effect can be explain without the use of potential so long a one give a full quantum mechanical treatment to the source charge that produce the electromagnetic field accord to this view the potential in quantum mechanic be just as physical or a it be classically aharonov cohen and rohrlich respond that the effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to field two paper publish in the journal physical review a in have demonstrate a quantum mechanical solution for the system their analysis show that the phase shift can be view a generate by solenoid vector potential acting on the electron or the electron vector potential acting on the solenoid or the electron and solenoid current act on the quantized vector potential global action local force similarly the effect illustrate that the lagrangian approach to dynamic base on energy be not just a computational aid to the newtonian approach base on force thus the effect validate the view that force be an incomplete way to formulate physic and potential energy must be use instead in fact richard feynman complain that he have be taught electromagnetism from the perspective of electromagnetic field and he wish later in life he have be teach to think in term of the electromagnetic potential instead a this would be more fundamental in feynman view of dynamic the potential field directly change the phase of an electron wave function and it be these change in phase that lead to measurable quantity locality of electromagnetic effect the effect show that the local and field do not contain full information about the electromagnetic field and the electromagnetic φ must be use instead by stokes theorem the magnitude of the effect can be calculate use the electromagnetic field alone or use the alone but when use just the electromagnetic field the effect depend on the field value in a region from which the test particle be exclude in contrast when use just the electromagnetic the effect only depend on the potential in the region where the test particle be allow therefore one must either abandon the principle of locality which most physicist be reluctant to do or accept that the electromagnetic offer a more complete description of electromagnetism than the electric and magnetic field can on the other hand the ab effect be crucially quantum mechanical quantum mechanic be well know to feature effect albeit still disallow superluminal communication and vaidman have argue that this be just a quantum effect in a different form in classical electromagnetism the two description be equivalent with the addition of quantum theory though the electromagnetic potential φ and be see a be more fundamental despite this all observable effect end up be expressible in term of the electromagnetic field and this be interesting because while you can calculate the electromagnetic field from the due to gauge freedom the reverse be not true the magnetic effect can be see a a result of the requirement that quantum physic be invariant with respect to the gauge choice for the electromagnetic potential of which the magnetic vector potential form part electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge travel along some path in a region with zero magnetic field but by acquire a phase shift give in si unit by therefore particle with the same start and end point but travel along two different route will acquire a phase difference determine by the magnetic flux through the area between the path via stokes theorem and and give by schematic of experiment in which the effect can be observe electron pass through two slit interfere at an observation screen with the interference pattern shift when a magnetic field be turn on in the cylindrical solenoid in quantum mechanic the same particle can travel between two point by a variety of path therefore this phase difference can be observe by place a solenoid between the slit of a experiment or equivalent an ideal solenoid infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution enclose a magnetic field but do not produce any magnetic field outside of it cylinder and thus the charge particle an electron passing outside experience no magnetic field however there be a vector potential outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux and so the relative phase of particle pass through one slit or the other be alter by whether the solenoid current be turn on or off this correspond to an observable shift of the interference fringe on the observation plane the same phase effect be responsible for the requirement in superconducting loop this quantization occur because the superconducting wave function must be single value it phase difference around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of with the charge for the electron cooper pair and thus the flux must be a multiple of the superconducting flux quantum be actually predict prior to aharonov and bohm by london in use a phenomenological model the first claim experimental confirmation be by robert chamber in in an electron interferometer with a magnetic field produce by a thin iron whisker and other early work be summarize in olariu and popèscu however subsequent author question the validity of several of these early result because the electron may not have be completely shield from the magnetic field an early experiment in which an unambiguous effect be observe by completely exclude the magnetic field from the electron path with the help of a superconducting film be perform by tonomura et al in the effect scope and application continue to expand webb et al demonstrate oscillation in ordinary metallic ring for a discussion see schwarzschild and imry webb bachtold et al detect the effect in carbon nanotube for a discussion see kong et al and dirac the magnetic effect be also closely relate to dirac argument that the existence of a magnetic monopole can be accommodate by the exist magnetic maxwell equation if both electric and magnetic charge be quantize a magnetic monopole imply a mathematical singularity in the vector potential which can be express a a dirac string of infinitesimal diameter that contain the equivalent of all of the g flux from a monopole charge g the dirac string start from and terminates on a magnetic monopole thus assume the absence of an scatter effect by this arbitrary choice of singularity the requirement of wave function a above necessitates that be must be an integer in cgs unit for any electric charge q e and magnetic charge q m like the electromagnetic potential the dirac string be not gauge invariant it move around with fixed endpoint under a gauge transformation and so be also not directly measurable just a the phase of the wave function depend upon the magnetic vector potential it also depend upon the scalar electric potential by construct a situation in which the electrostatic potential varies for two path of a particle through region of zero electric field an observable interference phenomenon from the phase shift have be predict again the absence of an electric field mean that classically there would be no effect from the schrödinger equation the phase of an eigenfunction with energy e go a the energy however will depend upon the electrostatic potential v for a particle with charge q in particular for a region with constant potential v zero field the electric potential energy qv be simply add to e result in a phase shift where t be the time spend in the potential the initial theoretical proposal for this effect suggest an experiment where charge pass through conduct cylinder along two path which shield the particle from external electric field in the region where they travel but still allow a time dependent potential to be apply by charge the cylinder this prove difficult to realize however instead a different experiment be propose involve a ring geometry interrupt by tunnel barrier with a constant bias voltage v relate the potential of the two half of the ring this situation result in an phase shift a above and be observe experimentally in albeit in a setup where the charge do traverse the electric field generate by the bias voltage the original time dependent electric effect have not yet find experimental verification nano ring be create by accident while intend to make quantum dot they have interest optical property associate with excitons and the effect application of these ring use a light capacitor or buffer include photonic computing and communication technology analysis and measurement of geometric phase in mesoscopic ring be ongoing it be even suggest they could be use to make a form of slow glass several experiment include some report in show oscillation in charge density wave cdw current versus magnetic flux of dominant period h e through cdw ring up to µm in circumference above this behavior be similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference device see squid the effect can be understand from the fact that one can only measure absolute value of the wave function while this allow for measurement of phase difference through quantum interference experiment there be no way to specify a wavefunction with constant absolute phase in the absence of an electromagnetic field one can come close by declare the eigenfunction of the momentum operator with zero momentum to be the function ignore normalization problem and specify wave function relative to this eigenfunction in this representation the operator be up to a factor the differential operator however by gauge invariance it be equally valid to declare the zero momentum eigenfunction to be at the cost of represent the operator up to a factor a with a pure gauge vector potential there be no real asymmetry because represent the former in term of the latter be just as messy a represent the latter in term of the former this mean that it be physically more natural to describe wave function in the language of differential geometry a section in a complex line bundle with a hermitian metric and a u the curvature form of the connection be up to the factor i the faraday tensor of the electromagnetic field strength the effect be then a manifestation of the fact that a connection with zero curvature flat need not be trivial since it can have monodromy along a topologically nontrivial path fully contain in the zero curvature field free region by definition this mean that section that be parallelly translate along a topologically non trivial path pick up a phase so that covariant constant section can not be define over the whole field free region give a trivialization of the a section the u be give by the corresponding to the electromagnetic a a where d mean exterior derivation on the minkowski space the monodromy be the holonomy of the flat connection the holonomy of a connection flat or non flat around a closed loop be one can show this do not depend on the trivialization but only on the connection for a flat connection one can find a gauge transformation in any simply connected field free region act on wave function and connection that gauge away the vector potential however if the monodromy be nontrivial there be no such gauge transformation for the whole outside region in fact a a consequence of stokes theorem the holonomy be determine by the magnetic flux through a surface bound the loop but such a surface may exist only if pass through a region of non trivial field the monodromy of the flat connection only depend on the topological type of the loop in the field free region in fact on the loops homology class the holonomy description be general however and work inside as well a outside the superconductor outside of the conducting tube contain the magnetic field the field strength in other word outside the tube the connection be flat and the monodromy of the loop contain in the region depend only on the wind number around the tube the monodromy of the connection for a loop go round once winding number be the phase difference of a particle interfering by propagate left and right of the superconducting tube contain the magnetic field if one want to ignore the physic inside the superconductor and only describe the physic in the outside region it become natural and mathematically convenient to describe the quantum electron by a section in a complex line bundle with an external flat connection with monodromy magnetic flux through the tube rather than an external em field the schrödinger equation readily generalize to this situation by use the laplacian of the connection for the free hamiltonian equivalently one can work in two simply connected region with cut that pass from the tube towards or away from the detection screen in each of these region the ordinary free schrödinger equation would have to be solve but in pass from one region to the other in only one of the two connect component of the intersection effectively in only one of the slit a monodromy factor be pick up which result in the shift in the interference pattern a one change the flux effect with similar mathematical interpretation can be find in other field for example in classical statistical physic quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment can be interpret a an effect induce by a gauge field act in the space of control parameter phase angle function phase loop number effect theorem the david bohm society page about the effect a video explain the use of the effect

codata value unit wb j the magnetic flux represent by the symbol thread some contour or loop be define a the magnetic field multiply by the loop area both and can be arbitrary and so be however if one deal with the superconducting loop or a hole in a bulk superconductor it turn out that the magnetic flux thread such a be quantize the superconducting flux quantum be a combination of fundamental physical constant the planck constant and the electron charge it value be therefore the same for any superconductor the phenomenon of flux quantization be discover experimentally by deaver and fairbank and independently by doll and näbauer in the quantization of magnetic flux be closely relate to the effect but be predict earlier by fritz london in use a phenomenological model the inverse of the flux quantum be call the constant and be denote j it be the constant of proportionality of the josephson effect relate the potential difference across a josephson junction to the frequency of the irradiation the josephson effect be very widely use to provide a standard for measurement of potential difference which since have be relate to a fixed conventional value of the josephson constant denote with the redefinition of si base unit the josephson constant have an exact value of j which replace the conventional value the following us si unit in cgs unit a factor of c would appear the superconducting property in each point of the superconductor be describe by the complex quantum mechanical wave function the superconducting order parameter a any complex function can be write a where be the amplitude and be the phase change the phase by will not change and correspondingly will not change any physical property however in the superconductor of topology superconductor with the hole or superconducting the phase may continuously change from some value to the value a one go around the and come to the same starting point if this be so then one have magnetic flux quantum trap in the a show below per minimal couple the probability current of cooper pair in the superconductor be here the wave function be the order parameter plug into the expression of probability current one obtains while inside the body of the superconductor the current density be zero therefore integrate around the use stokes theorem and give now because the order parameter must return to the same value when the integral go back to the same point we have due to the meissner effect the magnetic induction inside the superconductor be zero more exactly magnetic field penetrate into a superconductor over a small distance call london magnetic field penetration depth denote and usually the screening current also flow in this near the surface create magnetization inside the superconductor which perfectly compensate the applied field thus result in inside the superconductor it be important to note that the magnetic flux frozen in a plus it will always be quantize however the value of the flux quantum be equal to only when the around the hole describe above can be choose so that it lay in the superconducting region without screen current several away from the surface there be geometry where this condition can not be satisfy a loop make of very thin superconducting wire or the cylinder with the similar wall thickness in the latter case the flux have a quantum different from the flux quantization be a key idea behind a squid which be one of the most sensitive magnetometer available flux quantization also play an important role in the physic of type ii superconductors when such a superconductor now without any hole be place in a magnetic field with the strength between the first critical field and the second critical field the field partially penetrate into the superconductor in a form of abrikosov vortex the abrikosov vortex consist of a normal cylinder of the normal phase with a diameter on the order of the the superconducting coherence length the normal core play a role of a hole in the superconducting phase the magnetic field line pass along this normal core through the whole sample the screening current circulate in the of the core and screen the rest of the superconductor from the magnetic field in the core in total each such abrikosov vortex carry one quantum of magnetic flux although theoretically it be possible to have more than one flux quantum per hole the abrikosov vortex with be unstable and split into several vortex with in a real hole the state with be stable a the real hole can not split itself into several small hole the magnetic flux

renormalization be a collection of technique in quantum field theory the statistical mechanic of field and the theory of geometric structure that be use to treat infinity arise in calculated quantity by alter value of quantity to compensate for effect of their but even if no infinity arise in loop diagram in quantum field theory it could be show that it would be necessary to renormalize the mass and field appear in the original lagrangian for example an electron theory may begin by postulate an electron with an initial mass and charge in quantum field theory a cloud of virtual particle such a photon positron and others surround and interacts with the initial electron accounting for the interaction of the surround particle collision at different energy show that the behaves a if it have a different mass and charge than initially postulate renormalization in this example mathematically replace the initially postulated mass and charge of an electron with the experimentally observed mass and charge mathematics and experiment prove that positron and more massive particle like proton exhibit precisely the same observed charge a the electron even in the presence of much strong interaction and more intense cloud of virtual particle renormalization specifies relationships between parameter in the theory when parameter describe large distance scale differ from parameter describe small distance scale in particle accelerator like the cern large hadron collider the concept name pileup occur when undesirable collision interact with data collection for simultaneous nearby desirable measurement physically the pileup of contribution from an infinity of scale involve in a problem may then result in further infinity when describe a a continuum certain statistical and quantum mechanical construction be not to define them or make them unambiguous a continuum limit must carefully remove construction scaffolding of lattice at various scale renormalization procedure be base on the requirement that certain physical quantity such a the mass and charge of an electron equal observe experimental value that be the experimental value of the physical quantity yield practical application but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represent area of quantum field theory that require deep derivation from theoretical base renormalization be first develop in quantum electrodynamics qed to make sense of infinite integral in perturbation theory initially view a a suspect provisional procedure even by some of it originator renormalization eventually be embrace a an important and actual mechanism of scale physic in several field of physic and mathematics today the point of view have shift on the basis of the breakthrough renormalization group insight of nikolay bogolyubov and kenneth wilson the focus be on variation of physical quantity across contiguous scale while distant scale be relate to each other through effective description scale be link in a broadly systematic way and the actual physic pertinent to each be extract with the suitable specific computational technique appropriate for each wilson clarify which variable of a system be crucial and which be redundant renormalization be distinct from regularization another technique to control infinity by assume the existence of new unknown physic at new scale figure renormalization in quantum electrodynamics the simple interaction that determine the electron charge at one renormalization point be reveal to consist of more complicated interaction at another the problem of infinity first arise in the classical electrodynamics of point particle in the and early century the mass of a charged particle should include the in it electrostatic field electromagnetic mass assume that the particle be a charged spherical shell of radius the in the field be which becomes infinite a this imply that the point particle would have infinite inertia make it unable to be accelerate incidentally the value of that make equal to the electron mass be call the classical electron radius which setting and restore factor of and turn out to be where be the constant and be the compton wavelength of the electron renormalization the total effective mass of a spherical charge particle include the actual bare mass of the spherical shell in addition to the mass mention above associate with it electric field if the shell bare mass be allow to be negative it might be possible to take a consistent point limit this be call renormalization and lorentz and abraham attempt to develop a classical theory of the electron this way this early work be the inspiration for later attempt at regularization and renormalization in quantum field theory see also regularization physic for an alternative way to remove infinity from this classical problem assume new physic exists at small scale when calculate the electromagnetic interaction of charge particle it be tempt to ignore the of a particle own field on itself analogous to the of circuit analysis but this be necessary to explain the friction on charge particle when they emit radiation if the electron be assume to be a point the value of the diverges for the same reason that the mass diverge because the field be the theory have a noncausal sometimes an electron would start move before the force be apply this be a sign that the point limit be inconsistent the trouble be bad in classical field theory than in quantum field theory because in quantum field theory a charge particle experience zitterbewegung due to interference with virtual pair thus effectively smear out the charge over a region comparable to the compton wavelength in quantum electrodynamics at small couple the electromagnetic mass only diverge a the logarithm of the radius of the particle a vacuum polarization charge screen this loop have a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence b diagram in qed c example of a diagram when develop quantum electrodynamics in the max born werner heisenberg pascual jordan and paul dirac discover that in perturbative correction many integral be divergent see the problem of infinity one way of describe the perturbation theory correction divergence be discover in by han kramers hans bethe julian schwinger richard feynman and tomonaga and systematize by freeman dyson in the divergence appear in radiative correction involve feynman diagram with closed loop of virtual particle in them while virtual particle obey conservation of energy and momentum they can have any energy and momentum even one that be not allow by the relativistic relation for the observed mass of that particle that be be not necessarily the squared mass of the particle in that process for a photon it could be nonzero such a particle be call when there be a loop the momentum of the particle involve in the loop be not uniquely determine by the energy and momentum of incoming and outgo particle a variation in the energy of one particle in the loop can be balance by an equal and opposite change in the energy of another particle in the loop without affect the incoming and outgo particle thus many variation be possible so to find the amplitude for the loop process one must integrate over all possible combination of energy and momentum that could travel around the loop these integral be often divergent that be they give infinite answer the divergence that be significant be the ultraviolet uv one an ultraviolet divergence can be describe a one that come from the region in the integral where all particle in the loop have large energy and momenta very short wavelength and fluctuation of the field in the path integral for the field very short between particle emission and absorption if the loop be think of a a sum over particle path so these divergence be phenomena show in the picture at the right margin there be exactly three divergent loop diagram in quantum electrodynamics a a photon create a virtual pair which then annihilate this be a vacuum polarization diagram b an electron quickly emits and reabsorb a virtual photon call a c an electron emit a photon emit a second photon and reabsorb the first this process be show in the section below in figure and it be call a vertex renormalization the feynman diagram for this be also call a due to it shape remotely resemble a penguin with the initial and final state electron a the arm and legs the second photon a the body and the first loop photon a the head the three divergence correspond to the three parameter in the theory under consideration the field normalization z the mass of the electron the charge of the electron the second class of divergence call an infrared divergence be due to massless particle like the photon every process involve charge particle emits infinitely many coherent photon of infinite wavelength and the amplitude for emit any finite number of photon be zero for photon these divergence be well understood for example at the order the vertex function have both ultraviolet and infrared divergence in contrast to the ultraviolet divergence the infrared divergence do not require the renormalization of a parameter in the theory involve the infrared divergence of the vertex diagram be remove by include a diagram similar to the vertex diagram with the follow important difference the photon connect the two leg of the electron be cut and replace by two real photon whose wavelength tend to infinity this diagram be equivalent to the bremsstrahlung process this additional diagram must be include because there be no physical way to distinguish a photon flow through a loop a in the vertex diagram and photon emit through bremsstrahlung from a mathematical point of view the ir divergence can be regularize by assume fractional differentiation a parameter for example be well define at but be uv divergent if we take the fractional derivative with respect to we obtain the ir divergence so we can cure ir divergence by turn them into uv divergence a loop divergence figure a diagram contribute to scatter in qed the loop have an ultraviolet divergence the diagram in figure show one of the several contribution to scatter in qed the electron on the left side of the diagram represent by the solid line start out with and end up with it emit a virtual photon carry to transfer energy and momentum to the other electron but in this diagram before that happen it emit another virtual photon carrying and it reabsorb this one after emit the other virtual photon energy and momentum conservation do not determine the uniquely so all possibility contribute equally and we must integrate this diagram amplitude end up with among other thing a factor from the loop of the various factor in this expression be gamma matrix a in the covariant formulation of the dirac equation they have to do with the spin of the electron the factor of be the electric coupling constant while the provide a heuristic definition of the contour of integration around the pole in the space of momentum the important part for our purpose be the dependency on of the three big factor in the integrand which be from the propagator of the two electron line and the photon line in the loop this have a piece with two power of on top that dominate at large value of pokorski this integral be divergent and infinite unless we cut it off at finite energy and momentum in some way similar loop divergence occur in other quantum field theories the solution be to realize that the quantity initially appear in the theory formula such a the formula for the lagrangian represent such thing a the electron electric charge and mass as well a the normalization of the quantum field themselves do not actually correspond to the physical constant measure in the laboratory a write they be bare quantity that do not take into account the contribution of loop effect to the physical constant themselves among other thing these effect would include the quantum counterpart of the electromagnetic that so vexed classical theorist of electromagnetism in general these effect would be just as divergent a the amplitude under consideration in the first place so finite measured quantity would in general imply divergent bare quantity to make contact with reality then the formula would have to be rewrite in term of measurable renormalized quantity the charge of the electron say would be define in term of a quantity measure at a specific kinematic renormalization point or subtraction point which will generally have a characteristic energy call the renormalization scale or simply the energy scale the part of the lagrangian left over involve the remain portion of the bare quantity could then be reinterpret a counterterms involve in divergent diagram exactly cancel out the troublesome divergence for other diagrams renormalization in qed figure the vertex correspond to the counterterm cancel the divergence in figure for example in the lagrangian of qed the field and couple constant be really bare quantity hence the subscript above conventionally the bare quantity be write so that the corresponding lagrangian term be multiple of the renormalized one gauge invariance via a identity turn out to imply that we can renormalize the two term of the covariant derivative piece together pokorski which be what happen to it be the same a a term in this lagrangian for example the interaction picture in figure can then be write the physical constant the electron charge can then be define in term of some specific experiment we set the renormalization scale equal to the energy characteristic of this experiment and the first term give the interaction we see in the laboratory up to small finite correction from loop diagram provide such exotica a the correction to the magnetic moment the rest be the counterterm if the theory be renormalizable see below for more on this a it be in qed the divergent part of loop diagram can all be decompose into piece with three or few leg with an algebraic form that can be cancel out by the second term or by the similar counterterms that come from and the diagram with the counterterm interaction vertex place a in figure cancel out the divergence from the loop in figure historically the splitting of the bare term into the original term and counterterms come before the renormalization group insight due to kenneth wilson accord to such renormalization group insight detail in the next section this splitting be unnatural and actually unphysical a all scale of the problem enter in continuous systematic way run coupling to minimize the contribution of loop diagram to a give calculation and therefore make it easy to extract result one choose a renormalization point close to the energy and momentum exchange in the interaction however the renormalization point be not itself a physical quantity the physical prediction of the theory calculate to all order should in principle be independent of the choice of renormalization point as long a it be within the domain of application of the theory change in renormalization scale will simply affect how much of a result come from feynman diagram without loop and how much come from the remain finite part of loop diagram one can exploit this fact to calculate the effective variation of physical constant with change in scale this variation be encode by and the general theory of this kind of be know a the renormalization group colloquially particle physicist often speak of certain physical constant a vary with the energy of interaction though in fact it be the renormalization scale that be the independent quantity this running do however provide a convenient mean of describe change in the behavior of a field theory under change in the energy involve in an interaction for example since the coupling in quantum chromodynamics become small at large energy scale the theory behave more like a free theory a the energy exchange in an interaction become large a phenomenon know a asymptotic freedom choose an increase energy scale and use the renormalization group make this clear from simple feynman diagram be this not do the prediction would be the same but would arise from complicated cancellation for example be to eliminate the divergence simply change low limit of integral into and make sure then since the quantity be in order to make this notion of cancel divergence precise the divergence first have to be tame mathematically use the theory of limit in a process know a regularization weinberg an essentially arbitrary modification to the loop integrands or regulator can make them drop off faster at high energy and momentum in such a manner that the integral converge a regulator have a characteristic energy scale know a the cutoff take this cutoff to infinity or equivalently the corresponding scale to zero recovers the original integral with the regulator in place and a finite value for the cutoff divergent term in the integral then turn into finite but term after cancel out these term with the contribution from counterterms the cutoff be take to infinity and finite physical result recover if physic on scale we can measure be independent of what happen at the very short distance and time scale then it should be possible to get result for calculation many different type of regulator be use in quantum field theory calculation each with it advantage and disadvantage one of the most popular in modern use be dimensional regularization invent by gerardus hooft and martinus veltman which tame the integral by carry them into a space with a fictitious fractional number of dimension another be regularization which add fictitious particle to the theory with very large mass such that loop integrands involve the massive particle cancel out the exist loop at large momentum yet another regularization scheme be the lattice regularization introduce by kenneth wilson which pretend that lattice construct our with fix grid size this size be a natural cutoff for the maximal momentum that a particle could possess when propagate on the lattice and after do a calculation on several lattice with different grid size the physical result be extrapolate to grid size or our natural universe this presuppose the existence of a scaling limit a rigorous mathematical approach to renormalization theory be the causal perturbation theory where ultraviolet divergence be avoid from the start in calculation by perform mathematical operation only within the framework of distribution theory in this approach divergence be replace by ambiguity correspond to a divergent diagram be a term which now have a finite but undetermined coefficient other principle such a gauge symmetry must then be use to reduce or eliminate the ambiguity zeta function regularization julian schwinger discover a relationship between zeta function regularization and renormalization use the asymptotic relation a the regulator base on this he consider use the value of to get finite result although he reach inconsistent result an improved formula study by hartle garcia and base on the work by elizalde include the technique of the zeta regularization algorithm where the b be the bernoulli number and so every can be write a a linear combination of or simply use formula we have for every divergent integral valid when here the zeta function be hurwitz zeta function and beta be a positive real number the geometric analogy be give by if we use rectangle method to evaluate the integral so use hurwitz zeta regularization plus the rectangle method with step h not to be confuse with planck constant the logarithmic divergent integral have the regularization since for the harmonic series in the limit we must recover the series for integral that will depend on several variable we can make a change of variable to polar coordinate and then replace the integral over the angle by a sum so we have only a divergent integral that will depend on the modulus and then we can apply the zeta regularization algorithm the main idea for integral be to replace the factor after a change to hyperspherical coordinate so the uv overlapping divergence be encode in variable in order to regularize these integral one need a regulator for the case of integral these regulator can be take a so the integral will converge for big enough use the zeta regularization we can analytic continue the variable to the physical limit where and then regularize any uv integral by replace a divergent integral by a linear combination of divergent series which can be regularize in term of the negative value of the riemann zeta function the early formulators of qed and other quantum field theory be a a rule dissatisfy with this state of affair it seem illegitimate to do something tantamount to subtract infinity from infinity to get finite answer freeman dyson argue that these infinity be of a basic nature and can not be eliminate by any formal mathematical procedure such a the renormalization method dirac criticism be the most persistent as late a he be say most physicist be very satisfied with the situation they say electrodynamics be a good theory and we do not have to worry about it any more i must say that i be very dissatisfied with the situation because this theory do involve neglect infinity which appear in it equation ignore them in an arbitrary way this be just not sensible mathematics sensible mathematics involve disregard a quantity when it be small not neglect it just because it be infinitely great and you do not want it another important critic be feynman despite his crucial role in the development of quantum electrodynamics he write the following in the shell game that we play be technically call but no matter how clever the word it be still what i would call a dippy process have to resort to such have prevent u from prove that the theory of quantum electrodynamics be mathematically it surprise that the theory still have be prove one way or the other by now i suspect that renormalization be not mathematically legitimate feynman be concern that all field theory know in the have the property that the interaction become infinitely strong at short enough distance scale this property call a landau pole make it plausible that quantum field theory be all inconsistent in gross politzer and wilczek show that another quantum field theory quantum chromodynamics do not have a landau pole feynman along with most others accept that qcd be a fully consistent theory the general unease be almost universal in text up to the and beginning in the however inspire by work on the renormalization group and effective field theory and despite the fact that dirac and various of whom belong to the old withdraw their criticism attitude begin to change especially among young theorist kenneth wilson and others demonstrate that the renormalization group be useful in statistical field theory apply to condensed matter physic where it provide important insight into the behavior of phase transition in condensed matter physic a physical regulator exist matter cease to be continuous on the scale of atom divergence in condensed matter physic do not present a philosophical problem since the field theory be only an effective representation of the behavior of matter anyway there be no infinity since the cutoff be always finite and it make perfect sense that the bare quantity be if qft hold all the way down past the planck length where it might yield to string theory causal set theory or something different then there may be no real problem with divergence in particle physic either all field theory could simply be effective field theory in a sense this approach echo the old attitude that the divergence in qft speak of human ignorance about the working of nature but also acknowledge that this ignorance can be quantify and that the result effective theory remain useful be that a it may salam remark in seem still relevant infinity first encounter in lorentz computation of electron have persist in classical electrodynamics for seventy and in quantum electrodynamics for some year these long year of frustration have leave in the subject a curious affection for the infinity and a passionate belief that they be an inevitable part of nature so much so that even the suggestion of a hope that they may after all be circumvent and finite value for the renormalization constant compute be consider irrational compare russell postscript to the third volume of his autobiography the final year george allen and unwin london in the modern world if community be unhappy it be often because they have ignorance habit belief and passion which be dearer to them than happiness or even life i find many men in our dangerous age who seem to be in love with misery and death and who grow angry when hope be suggest to them they think hope be irrational and that in sit down to lazy despair they be merely facing fact in qft the value of a physical constant in general depends on the scale that one choose a the renormalization point and it become very interesting to examine the renormalization group run of physical constant under change in the energy scale the coupling constant in the standard model of particle physic vary in different way with increase energy scale the coupling of quantum chromodynamics and the weak isospin coupling of the electroweak force tend to decrease and the weak hypercharge coupling of the electroweak force tend to increase at the colossal energy scale of gev far beyond the reach of our current particle accelerator they all become approximately the same size grotz and klapdor a major motivation for speculation about grand unified theory instead of be only a worrisome problem renormalization have become an important theoretical tool for study the behavior of field theory in different regime if a theory feature renormalization qed can only be sensibly interpret a an effective field theory a an approximation reflect human ignorance about the working of nature then the problem remain of discover a more accurate theory that do not have these renormalization problem a lewis ryder have put it in the quantum theory these classical divergence do not disappear on the contrary they appear to get bad and despite the comparative success of renormalisation theory the feeling remain that there ought to be a more satisfactory way of do thing from this philosophical reassessment a new concept follow naturally the notion of renormalizability not all theory lend themselves to renormalization in the manner describe above with a finite supply of counterterms and all quantity become at the end of the calculation if the lagrangian contain combination of field operator of high enough dimension in energy unit the counterterms require to cancel all divergence proliferate to infinite number and at first glance the theory would seem to gain an infinite number of free parameter and therefore lose all predictive power become scientifically worthless such theory be call nonrenormalizable the standard model of particle physic contain only renormalizable operator but the interaction of general relativity become nonrenormalizable operator if one attempt to construct a field theory of quantum gravity in the most straightforward manner treat the metric in the lagrangian a a perturbation about the minkowski metric suggest that perturbation theory be useless in application to quantum gravity however in an effective field theory renormalizability be strictly speak a misnomer in nonrenormalizable effective field theory term in the lagrangian do multiply to infinity but have coefficient suppress by inverse power of the energy cutoff if the cutoff be a real physical be if the theory be only an effective description of physic up to some maximum energy or minimum distance these additional term could represent real physical interaction assume that the dimensionless constant in the theory do not get too large one can group calculation by inverse power of the cutoff and extract approximate prediction to finite order in the cutoff that still have a finite number of free parameter it can even be useful to renormalize these nonrenormalizable interaction nonrenormalizable interaction in effective field theory rapidly become weaker a the energy scale become much small than the cutoff the classic example be the fermi theory of the weak nuclear force a nonrenormalizable effective theory whose cutoff be comparable to the mass of the w particle this fact may also provide a possible explanation for why almost all of the particle interaction we see be describable by renormalizable theory it may be that any others that may exist at the gut or planck scale simply become too weak to detect in the realm we can observe with one exception gravity whose exceedingly weak interaction be magnify by the presence of the enormous mass of star and planet in actual calculation the counterterms introduce to cancel the

and a certain set of couple constant this function may be a partition function an action a hamiltonian etc it must contain the whole description of the physic of the system now we consider a certain block transformation of the state variables the number of must be low than the number of now let u try to rewrite the function only in term of the if this be achievable by a certain change in the parameter then the theory be say to be renormalizable the possible macroscopic state of the system at a large scale be give by this set of fixed point group fix the most important information in the rg flow be it point a fixed point be define by the vanishing of the beta function associate to the flow then fix point of the renormalization group be by definition scale invariant in many case of physical interest scale invariance enlarges to conformal invariance one then have a conformal field theory at the fixed point the ability of several theory to flow to the same fixed point lead to universality if these fix point correspond to free field theory the theory be say to exhibit quantum triviality numerous fixed point appear in the study of lattice higgs theory but the nature of the

in theoretical physic the group refer to a mathematical apparatus that allow systematic investigation of the change of a physical system a view at different scale in particle physic it reflect the change in the underlying force law codify in a quantum field theory a the energy scale at which physical process occur varies and resolution distance scale be effectively conjugate under the uncertainty principle a change in scale be call a scale transformation the renormalization group be intimately relate to scale invariance and conformal invariance symmetry in which a system appear the same at all scale a the scale varies it be a if one be change the magnify power of a notional microscope view the system in renormalizable theory the system at one scale will generally be see to consist of copy of itself when view at a small scale with different parameter describe the component of the system the component or fundamental variable may relate to atom elementary particle atomic spin etc the parameter of the theory typically describe the interaction of the component these may be variable coupling which measure the strength of various force or mass parameter themselves the component themselves may appear to be compose of more of the component a one go to shorter distance for example in quantum electrodynamics qed an electron appear to be compose of electron positron and photon a one view it at high resolution at very short distance the electron at such short distance have a slightly different electric charge than do the dress electron see at large distance and this change or running in the value of the electric charge be determine by the renormalization group equation the idea of scale transformation and scale invariance be old in physic scale argument be commonplace for the pythagorean school euclid and up to galileo they become popular again at the end of the century perhaps the first example be the idea of enhanced viscosity of osborne reynolds a a way to explain turbulence the renormalization group be initially devise in particle physic but nowadays it application extend to physic fluid mechanic physical cosmology and even nanotechnology an early article by ernst stueckelberg and andré petermann in anticipate the idea in quantum field theory stueckelberg and petermann open the field conceptually they note that renormalization exhibit a group of transformation which transfer quantity from the bare term to the counter term they introduce a function h e in quantum electrodynamics qed which be now call the beta function see below murray and francis low restrict the idea to scale transformation in qed in which be the most physically significant and focus on asymptotic form of the photon propagator at high energy they determine the variation of the electromagnetic coupling in qed by appreciate the simplicity of the scaling structure of that theory they thus discover that the coupling parameter g μ at the energy scale μ be effectively give by the group equation or equivalently for some function g call wegner scaling function and a constant d in term of the couple g m at a reference scale m and low realize in these result that the effective scale can be arbitrarily take a μ and can vary to define the theory at any other scale the gist of the rg be this group property a the scale μ vary the theory present a replica of itself and any scale can be access similarly from any other scale by group action a formal transitive conjugacy of coupling in the mathematical sense schröder equation on the basis of this finite group equation and it scaling property and low could then focus on infinitesimal transformation and invent a computational method base on a mathematical flow function of the coupling parameter g which they introduce like the function h e of stueckelberg and petermann their function determine the differential change of the couple g μ with respect to a small change in energy scale μ through a differential equation the renormalization group equation the modern name be also indicate the beta function introduce by callan and symanzik in since it be a mere function of g integration in g of a perturbative estimate of it permit specification of the renormalization trajectory of the coupling that be it variation with energy effectively the function g in this perturbative approximation the renormalization group prediction cf and work be confirm year later at the lep accelerator experiment the fine structure constant of qed be measure to be about at energy close to gev a oppose to the standard physic value of deep understand the renormalization group emerge from the renormalization of the quantum field variable which normally have to address the problem of infinity in a quantum field theory this problem of systematically handle the infinity of quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantity be solve for qed by richard feynman julian schwinger and tomonaga who receive the nobel prize for these contribution they effectively devise the theory of mass and charge renormalization in which the infinity in the momentum scale be cut off by an regulator λ the dependence of physical quantity such a the electric charge or electron mass on the scale λ be hide effectively swap for the scale at which the physical quantity be measure and a a result all observable quantity end up be finite instead even for an infinite and low thus realize in these result that infinitesimally while a tiny change in g be provide by the above rg equation give ψ g the be express by the fact that ψ g depend explicitly only upon the parameter s of the theory and not upon the scale μ consequently the above renormalization group equation may be solve for g and thus g μ a deep understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process which go beyond the dilation group of conventional renormalizable theory considers method where widely different scale of lengths appear simultaneously it come from condense matter physic leo kadanoff paper in propose the renormalization group the block idea be a way to define the component of the theory at large distance a aggregate of component at short distance this approach cover the conceptual point and be give full computational substance in the extensive important contribution of kenneth wilson the power of wilson idea be demonstrate by a constructive iterative renormalization solution of a problem the kondo problem in as well a the precede seminal development of his new method in the theory of phase transition and critical phenomenon in he be award the nobel prize for these decisive contribution in meanwhile the rg in particle physic have be reformulate in more practical term by callan and symanzik in the above beta function which describe the running of the couple parameter with scale be also find to amount to the canonical trace anomaly which represent the breaking of scale dilation symmetry in a field theory application of the rg to particle physic explode in number in the with the establishment of the standard model in it be discover that a theory of interact color quark call quantum chromodynamics have a negative beta function this mean that an initial value of the coupling will eventuate a special value of at which the coupling blow up diverges this special value be the scale of the strong interaction and occurs at about mev conversely the coupling become weak at very high energy asymptotic freedom and the quark become observable a particle in deep inelastic scattering a anticipate by scale qcd be thereby establish a the quantum field theory control the strong interaction of particle momentum space rg also become a highly developed tool in solid state physic but be hinder by the extensive use of perturbation theory which prevent the theory from succeed in strongly correlate system conformal symmetry the conformal symmetry be associate with the vanishing of the beta function this can occur naturally if a coupling constant be attract by run toward a fixed point at which β g in qcd the fixed point occur at short distance where g and be call a trivial ultraviolet fix point for heavy quark such a the top quark the coupling to the higgs boson run toward a fix infrared fix point first predict by pendleton and ross and hill the top quark yukawa couple lie slightly below the infrared fixed point of the standard model suggest the possibility of additional new physic such a sequential heavy higgs boson in string theory conformal invariance of the string be a fundamental symmetry β be a requirement here β be a function of the geometry of the in which the string move this determine the dimensionality of the string theory and enforces einstein equation of general relativity on the geometry the rg be of fundamental importance to string theory and theory of grand unification it be also the modern key idea underlie critical phenomenon in condensed matter physic indeed the rg have become one of the most important tool of modern physic it be often use in combination with the monte carlo method this section introduce pedagogically a picture of rg which may be easy to grasp the block spin rg devise by leo kadanoff in consider a solid a set of atom in a perfect square array a depict in the figure assume that atom interact among themselves only with their near neighbour and that the system be at a give temperature the strength of their interaction be quantify by a certain couple the physic of the system will be describe by a certain formula say the hamiltonian now proceed to divide the solid into of square we attempt to describe the system in term of variable variable which describe the average behavior of the block far assume that by some lucky coincidence the physic of block variable be describe by a formula of the same kind but with value for and this be exactly true in general but it be often a good first approximation perhaps the initial problem be too hard to solve since there be too many atom now in the problem we have only one fourth of them but why stop now another iteration of the same kind lead to and only one sixteenth of the atom we be increase the scale with each rg step of course the best idea be to iterate until there be only one very big block since the number of atom in any real sample of material be very large this be more or less equivalent to find the long range behaviour of the rg transformation which take and often when iterate many time this rg transformation lead to a certain number of point to be more concrete consider a magnetic system the ising model in which the coupling denote the trend of neighbour spin to be parallel the configuration of the system be the result of the tradeoff between the order term and the disorder effect of temperature for many model of this kind there be three fixed point and this mean that at the large size temperature become unimportant the disorder factor vanishes thus in large scale the system appear to be order we be in a ferromagnetic phase and exactly the opposite here temperature dominates and the system be disorder at large scale a nontrivial point between them c and c in this point change the scale do not change the physic because the system be in a fractal state it correspond to the curie phase transition and be also call a critical point so if we be give a certain material with give value of and all we have to do in order to find out the behaviour of the system be to iterate the pair until we find the corresponding fixed point in more technical term let u assume that we have a theory describe by a certain function of the state variable and a certain set of couple constant this function may be a partition function an action a hamiltonian etc it must contain the whole description of the physic of the system now we consider a certain block transformation of the state variables the number of must be low than the number of now let u try to rewrite the function only in term of the if this be achievable by a certain change in the parameter then the theory be say to be for some reason most fundamental theory of physic such a quantum electrodynamics quantum chromodynamics and interaction but not gravity be exactly renormalizable also most theory in condensed matter physic be approximately renormalizable from superconductivity to fluid turbulence the change in the parameter be implement by a certain beta function which be say to induce a flow or flow on the the value of under the flow be call coupling a be state in the previous section the most important information in the rg flow be it point the possible macroscopic state of the system at a large scale be give by this set of fixed point if these fix point correspond to a free field theory the theory be say to exhibit quantum triviality possess what be call a landau pole a in quantum electrodynamics for a interaction michael aizenman prove that this theory be indeed trivial for dimension for the triviality have yet to be proven rigorously pending recent submission to the arxiv but lattice computation have provide strong evidence for this this fact be important a quantum triviality can be use to bind or even predict parameter such a the higgs boson mass in asymptotic safety scenario numerous fixed point appear in the study of lattice higgs theory but the nature of the quantum field theory associate with these remains an open question since the rg transformation in such system be the number of variable decrease see a an example in a different context lossy data compression there need not be an inverse for a give rg transformation thus in such lossy system the renormalization group be in fact a semigroup and irrelevant operator and universality consider a certain observable of a physical system undergo an rg transformation the magnitude of the observable a the length scale of the system go from small to large determines the importance of the observable s for the scaling law if it magnitude then the observable be always increase always decrease other a relevant observable be need to describe the macroscopic behaviour of the system irrelevant observables be not need observables may or may not need to be take into account a remarkable broad fact be that most observables be irrelevant the macroscopic physic be dominate by only a few observables in most system a an example in microscopic physic to describe a system consist of a mole of atom we need of the order of avogadro number variable while to describe it a a macroscopic system gram of we only need a few before wilson rg approach there be an astonishing empirical fact to explain the coincidence of the critical exponent the exponent of the dependence of several quantity near a second order phase transition in very disparate phenomenon such a magnetic system superfluid transition lambda transition alloy physic etc so in general thermodynamic feature of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of variable such a the dimensionality and symmetry but be insensitive to detail of the underlie microscopic property of the system this coincidence of critical exponent for ostensibly quite different physical system call universality be easily explain use the renormalization group by demonstrate that the difference in phenomenon among the individual component be determine by irrelevant observables while the relevant observables be share in common hence many macroscopic phenomenon may be group into a small set of class specify by the share set of relevant observables renormalization group in practice come in two main flavour the kadanoff picture explain above refers mainly to the rg rg on the other hand have a longer history despite it relative subtlety it can be use for system where the degree of freedom can be cast in term of the fourier mode of a give field the rg transformation proceeds by integrate out a certain set of mode since large wavenumbers be relate to scale the rg result in an essentially analogous effect a with rg rg be usually perform on a perturbation expansion the validity of such an expansion be predicate upon the actual physic of a system be close to that of a free field system in this case one may calculate observables by sum the lead term in the expansion this approach have prove successful for many theory include most of particle physic but fail for system whose physic be very far from any free system system with strong correlation a an example of the physical meaning of rg in particle physic consider an overview of charge renormalization in quantum electrodynamics qed suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true or magnitude the electromagnetic field around it have a certain energy and thus may produce some virtual pair for example although virtual particle annihilate very quickly during their short live the electron will be attract by the charge and the positron will be repel since this happen uniformly everywhere near the point charge where it electric field be sufficiently strong these pair effectively create a screen around the charge when view from far away the measured strength of the charge will depend on how close our measure probe can approach the point charge bypass more of the screen of virtual particle the closer it get hence a dependence of a certain coupling constant here the electric charge with distance scale momentum and length scale be relate inversely accord to the de broglie relation the high the energy or momentum scale we may reach the low the length scale we may probe and resolve therefore the rg practitioner sometimes declaim to integrate out high momentum or high energy from their theory an renormalization group equation be one that take irrelevant coupling into account there be several formulation the erge be the simple conceptually but be practically impossible to implement fourier transform into momentum space after wick rotate into euclidean space insist upon a hard momentum cutoff so that the only degree of freedom be those with momentum less than the partition function be for any positive less than define a functional over field configuration whose fourier transform have momentum support within a obviously in fact this transformation be transitive if you compute from and then compute from this give you the same wilsonian action a compute directly from sλ the erge involve a smooth uv regulator cutoff basically the idea be an improvement over the wilson erge instead of a sharp momentum cutoff it use a smooth cutoff essentially we suppress contribution from momentum great than heavily the smoothness of the cutoff however allow u to derive a functional differential equation in the cutoff scale a in wilson approach we have a different action functional for each cutoff energy scale each of these action be suppose to describe exactly the same model which mean that their partition functionals have to match exactly in other word for a real scalar field generalization to other field be obvious and zλ be really independent of we have use the condensed dewitt notation here we have also split the bare action sλ into a quadratic kinetic part and an interacting part sint λ this split most certainly be clean the interacting part can very well also contain quadratic kinetic term in fact if there be any wave function renormalization it most certainly will this can be somewhat reduce by introduce field rescalings rλ be a function of the momentum p and the second term in the exponent be when expand when be essentially when becomes very very huge and approach infinity be always great than or equal to and be smooth basically this leave the fluctuation with momentum less than the cutoff unaffected but heavily suppresses contribution from fluctuation with momentum great than the cutoff this be obviously a huge improvement over wilson the condition that can be satisfy by but not only by jacques distler claim without proof that this erge be not correct nonperturbatively the average action erge involve a smooth ir regulator cutoff the idea be to take all fluctuation right up to an ir scale into account the average action will be accurate for fluctuation with momentum large than a the parameter be lower the effective average action approach the effective action which include all quantum and classical fluctuation in contrast for large the effective average action be close to the bare action so the effective average action interpolate between the bare action and the effective action for a real scalar field one add an ir cutoff to the action where rk be a function of both and such that for rk p be very tiny and approach and for rk be both smooth and nonnegative it large value for small momentum lead to a suppression of their contribution to the partition function which be effectively the same thing a neglecting fluctuation one can use the condensed dewitt notation for this ir regulator so where be the source field the legendre transform of wk ordinarily give the effective action however the action that we start off with be really and so to get the effective average action we subtract off in other word can be invert to give jkφ and we define the effective average action γk a hence thus be the erge which be also know a the wetterich equation a show by morris the effective action γk be in fact simply relate to polchinski effective action sint via a legendre transform relation a there be infinitely many choice of k there be also infinitely many different interpolate erges generalization to other field like spinorial field be straightforward although the polchinski erge and the effective average action erge look similar they be base upon very different philosophy in the effective average action erge the bare action be leave unchanged and the uv cutoff there be also left unchanged but the ir contribution to the effective action be suppress whereas in the polchinski erge the qft be fix once and for all but the bare action be vary at different energy scale to reproduce the prespecified model polchinski version be certainly much closer to wilson idea in spirit note that one use bare action whereas the other us effective average

in physic the axiom also call axiom name after lars gårding and arthur wightman be an attempt at a mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum field theory arthur wightman formulate the axiom in the early but they be first publish only in after scatter theory affirm their significance the axiom exist in the context of constructive quantum field theory and they be mean to provide a basis for rigorous treatment of quantum field and strict foundation for the perturbative method use one of the millennium problem be to realize the wightman axioms in the case of field one basic idea of the wightman axioms be that there be a hilbert space upon which the poincaré group act unitarily in this way the concept of energy momentum angular momentum and center of mass correspond to boost be implement there be also a stability assumption which restrict the spectrum of the to the positive light cone and it boundary however this be enough to implement locality for that the wightman axiom have position dependent operator call quantum field which form covariant representation of the poincaré group since quantum field theory suffers from ultraviolet problem the value of a field at a point be not to get around this the wightman axioms introduce the idea of smear over a test function to tame the uv divergence which arise even in a free field theory because the axiom be deal with unbounded operator the domain of the operator have to be specify the wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory by impose either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separate field they also postulate the existence of a state call the vacuum and demand it be unique moreover the axiom assume that the vacuum be cyclic that the set of all vector which can be obtain by evaluate at the vacuum state element of the polynomial algebra generate by the smeared field operator be a dense subset of the whole hilbert space lastly there be the primitive causality restriction which state that any polynomial in the smeared field can be arbitrarily accurately approximate be the limit of operator in the weak topology by polynomial in smeared field over test function with support in an open set in minkowski space whose causal closure be the whole minkowski space assumption of relativistic quantum mechanic quantum mechanic be describe accord to von neumann in particular the pure state be give by the ray the subspace of some separable complex hilbert space in the follow the scalar product of hilbert space vector ψ and φ will be denote by and the norm of ψ will be denote by the transition probability between two pure state ψ and φ can be define in term of vector representative ψ and φ to be and be independent of which representative vector ψ and φ be choose the theory of symmetry be describe accord to wigner this be to take advantage of the successful description of relativistic particle by eugene paul wigner in his famous paper of see wigner classification wigner postulate the transition probability between state to be the same to all observer relate by a transformation of special relativity more generally he consider the statement that a theory be invariant under a group g to be express in term of the invariance of the transition probability between any two ray the statement postulate that the group act on the set of ray that be on projective space let a be an element of the poincaré group the inhomogeneous lorentz group thus a be a real lorentz represent the change of origin x x a where x be in the minkowski space m and l be a lorentz transformation which can be define a a linear transformation of which preserve the lorentz distance x x of every vector ct then the theory be invariant under the poincaré group if for every ray ψ of the hilbert space and every group element a be give a transformed ray ψ a and the transition probability be unchanged by the transformation wigner theorem say that under these condition the transformation on the hilbert space be either linear or operator if moreover they preserve the norm then they be unitary or antiunitary operator the symmetry operator on the projective space of ray can be lift to the underlie hilbert space this be do for each group element a l we get a family of unitary or antiunitary operator u a l on our hilbert space such that the ray ψ transform by a l be the same a the ray contain u a l ψ if we restrict attention to element of the group connect to the identity then the case do not occur let a l and b m be two poincaré transformation and let u denote their group product by a l b from the physical interpretation we see that the ray contain u a l b m ψ must for any psi be the ray contain u a l b m ψ associativity of the group operation go back from the ray to the hilbert space these two vector may differ by a phase and not in norm because we choose unitary operator which can depend on the two group elements a l and b m we do have a representation of a group but rather a projective representation these phase ca always be cancel by redefine each u a example for particle of spin wigner show that the best one can get for poincare group be the phase be a multiple of for particle of integer spin pion photon graviton one can remove the sign by further phase change but for representation of we can not and the sign change discontinuously a we go round any axis by an angle of we can however construct a representation of the cover group of the poincare group call the inhomogeneous sl c this have elements a a where a before a be a but now a be a complex matrix with unit determinant we denote the unitary operator we get by u a a and these give u a continuous unitary and true representation in that the collection of u a obey the group law of the inhomogeneous sl c because of the under rotation by hermitian operator transform a spin can not be observables this show up a the univalence superselection rule phase between state of spin etc and those of spin be not observable this rule be in addition to the of the overall phase of a state vector concern the observables and state v we get a representation u a l of poincaré group on integer spin subspace and u a a of the inhomogeneous sl c on subspace which act accord to the follow interpretation an ensemble corresponding to u a l v be to be interpret with respect to the coordinate in exactly the same way a an ensemble corresponding to v be interpret with respect to the coordinate x and similarly for the odd subspaces the group of translation be commutative and so the operator can be simultaneously diagonalise the generator of these group give u four operator j which transform under the homogeneous group a a call the the second part of the zeroth axiom of wightman be that the representation u a a fulfill the spectral condition that the simultaneous spectrum of be contain in the forward cone the third part of the axiom be that there be a unique state represent by a ray in the hilbert space which be invariant under the action of the poincaré group it be call a vacuum assumption on the domain and continuity of the field for each test function f there exist a set of operator which together with their adjoints be define on a dense subset of the hilbert state space contain the vacuum the field a be tempered distribution the hilbert state space be span by the field polynomial act on the vacuum cyclicity condition transformation law of the field the field be covariant under the action of poincaré group and they transform accord to some representation s of the lorentz group or sl c if the spin be not integer local commutativity or microscopic causality if the support of two field be separate then the field either commute or anticommute cyclicity of a vacuum and uniqueness of a vacuum be sometimes consider separately also there be property of asymptotic completeness that hilbert state space be span by the asymptotic space and appear in the collision s matrix the other important property of field theory be mass gap which be not require by the axiom that spectrum have a gap between zero and some positive number from these axiom certain general theorem follow cpt theorem there be general symmetry under change of parity reversal and time inversion none of these symmetry alone exist in nature a it turn out connection between spin and statistic field which transform accord to half integer spin anticommute while those with integer spin commute axiom there be actually technical fine detail to this theorem this can be patch up use klein transformation see parastatistics see also the ghost in brst the impossibility of superluminal communication if two observer be spacelike separate then the action of one observer include both measurement and change to the hamiltonian do not affect the measurement statistic of the other observer arthur wightman show that the vacuum expectation value distribution satisfy certain set of property which follow from the axiom be sufficient to reconstruct the field theory wightman reconstruction theorem include the existence of a vacuum state he do not find the condition on the vacuum expectation value guarantee the uniqueness of the vacuum this condition the cluster property be find later by re jost klaus hepp david ruelle and othmar steinmann if the theory have a mass gap there be no mass between and some constant great than zero then vacuum expectation distribution be asymptotically independent in distant region haag theorem say that there can be no interaction picture that we can not use the fock space of noninteracting particle a a hilbert space in the sense that we would identify hilbert space via field polynomial act on a vacuum at a certain time the wightman framework do not cover infinite energy state like finite temperature state unlike local quantum field theory the wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory explicitly by impose either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separate field instead of derive the causal structure a a theorem if one consider a generalization of the wightman axioms to dimension other than this anti commutativity postulate rule out anyons and braid statistic in low dimension the wightman postulate of a unique vacuum state do necessarily make the wightman axioms inappropriate for the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking because we can always restrict ourselves to a superselection sector the cyclicity of the vacuum demand by the wightman axiom mean that they describe only the superselection sector of the vacuum again that be not a great loss of generality however this assumption do leave out finite energy state like soliton which ca be generate by a polynomial of field smear by test function because a soliton at least from a field theoretic perspective be a global structure involve topological boundary condition at infinity the wightman framework do not cover effective field theory because there be no limit a to how small the support of a test function can be there be no cutoff scale the wightman framework also do not cover gauge theory even in abelian gauge theory conventional approach start off with a hilbert space with an indefinite norm hence not truly a hilbert space which require a norm but physicists call it a hilbert space nonetheless and the physical state and physical operator belong to a cohomology this obviously be not cover anywhere in the wightman framework however a show by schwinger christ and lee gribov zwanziger van baal canonical quantization of gauge theory in coulomb gauge be possible with an ordinary hilbert space and this might be the way to make them fall under the applicability of the axiom systematics the wightman axiom can be rephrase in term of a state call a wightman functional on a borchers algebra equal to the tensor algebra of a space of test function one can generalize the wightman axioms to dimension other than in dimension and interacting theory which satisfy the axiom have be construct currently there be no proof that the wightman axiom can be satisfy for interact

constituent can be analyze to predict secondary tertiary and quaternary protein structure protein structure prediction be the inference of the structure of a protein from it amino acid be the prediction of it folding and it secondary and tertiary structure from it primary structure structure prediction be fundamentally different from the inverse problem of protein design protein structure prediction be one of the most important goal pursue by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry it be highly important in medicine for example in drug design and biotechnology for example in the design of novel enzyme every two year the performance of current method be assess in the casp experiment critical assessment of technique for protein structure prediction a continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction web server be perform by the community project protein be chain of amino acid join together by peptide bond many conformation of this chain be possible due to the rotation of the chain about each cα atom it be these conformational change that be responsible for difference in the three dimensional structure of protein each amino acid in the chain be polar it have separate positive and negative charge region with a free carbonyl group which can act a hydrogen bond acceptor and an nh group which can act a hydrogen bond donor these group can therefore interact in the protein structure the amino acid can be classify accord to the chemistry of the side chain which also play an important structural role glycine take on a special position a it have the small side chain only one hydrogen atom and therefore can increase the local flexibility in the protein structure cysteine on the other hand can react with another cysteine residue and thereby form a cross link stabilize the whole structure the protein structure can be consider a a sequence of secondary structure element such a α helix and β sheet which together constitute the overall configuration of the protein chain in these secondary structure regular pattern of h bond be form between neighbor amino acid and the amino acid have similar φ and ψ angle bond angle for φ and ψ the formation of these structure neutralize the polar group on each amino acid the secondary structure be tightly pack in the protein core in a hydrophobic environment each amino acid side group have a limited volume to occupy and a limited number of possible interaction with other nearby side chain a situation that must be take into account in molecular modeling and alignments the α helix be the most abundant type of secondary structure in proteins the α helix have amino acid per turn with an h bond form between every fourth residue the average length be amino acid turn or å but varies from to to turn the alignment of the h bond create a dipole moment for the helix with a result partial positive charge at the amino end of the helix because this region have free group it will interact with negatively charge group such a phosphate the most common location of α helix be at the surface of protein core where they provide an interface with the aqueous environment the side of the helix tend to have hydrophobic amino acid and the side hydrophilic amino acid thus every third of four amino acid along the chain will tend to be hydrophobic a pattern that can be quite readily detect in the leucine zipper motif a repeat pattern of leucine on the face side of two adjacent helix be highly predictive of the motif a plot can be use to show this repeated pattern other α helix bury in the protein core or in cellular membrane have a high and more regular distribution of hydrophobic amino acid and be highly predictive of such structure helix expose on the surface have a low proportion of hydrophobic amino acid amino acid content can be predictive of an α region region richer in alanine a glutamic acid e leucine l and methionine m and poorer in proline p glycine g tyrosine y and serine s tend to form an α helix proline destabilize or break an α helix but can be present in long helix form a bend an with hydrogen bond yellow dot β sheet be form by h bond between an average of consecutive amino acid in one portion of the chain with another farther down the chain the interacting region may be adjacent with a short loop in between or far apart with other structure in between every chain may run in the same direction to form a parallel sheet every other chain may run in the reverse chemical direction to form an anti parallel sheet or the chain may be parallel and anti parallel to form a mixed sheet the pattern of h bonding be different in the parallel and anti parallel configuration each amino acid in the interior strand of the sheet form two h bond with neighbor amino acid whereas each amino acid on the outside strand form only one bond with an interior strand look across the sheet at right angle to the strand more distant strand be rotate slightly counterclockwise to form a twist the cα atom alternate above and below the sheet in a pleated structure and the r side group of the amino acid alternate above and below the pleat the φ and ψ angle of the amino acid in sheet vary considerably in one region of the ramachandran plot it be more difficult to predict the location of β sheet than of α helix the situation improve somewhat when the amino acid variation in multiple sequence alignment be take into account loop be region of a protein chain that be between α helix and β sheet of various length and configuration and on the surface of the structure hairpin loop that represent a complete turn in the polypeptide chain join two antiparallel β strand may be as short a two amino acid in length loop interact with the surround aqueous environment and other protein because amino acid in loop be not constrain by space and environment a be amino acid in the core region and do not have an effect on the arrangement of secondary structure in the core more substitution insertion and deletion may occur thus in a sequence alignment the presence of these feature may be an indication of a loop the position of intron in genomic dna sometimes correspond to the location of loop in the encoded protein loop also tend to have charge and polar amino acid and be frequently a component of active site a detailed examination of loop structure have show that they fall into distinct family a region of secondary structure that be not an α helix a β sheet or a recognizable turn be commonly refer to a a coil protein may be classify accord to both structural and sequence similarity for structural classification the size and spatial arrangement of secondary structure describe in the above paragraph be compare in known structure classification base on sequence similarity be historically the first to be use initially similarity base on alignment of whole sequence be perform later protein be classify on the basis of the occurrence of conserve amino acid pattern databases that classify protein by one or more of these scheme be available in consider protein classification scheme it be important to keep several observation in mind first two entirely different protein sequence from different evolutionary origin may fold into a similar structure conversely the sequence of an ancient gene for a give structure may have diverge considerably in different specie while at the same time maintain the same basic structural feature recognize any remain sequence similarity in such case may be a very difficult task second two protein that share a significant degree of sequence similarity either with each other or with a third sequence also share an evolutionary origin and should share some structural feature also however gene duplication and genetic rearrangement during evolution may give rise to new gene copy which can then evolve into protein with new function and structure use for classify protein structure and the more commonly use term for evolutionary and structural relationship among protein be list below many additional term be use for various kind of structural feature find in protein description of such term may be find at the cath web site the structural classification of protein scop web site and a glaxo wellcome tutorial on the swiss bioinformatics expasy web site active site a localized combination of amino acid side group within the tertiary or quaternary protein subunit structure that can interact with a chemically specific substrate and that provide the protein with biological activity protein of very different amino acid sequence may fold into a structure that produce the same active site architecture be the relative orientation of secondary structure in a structure without regard to whether or not they share a similar loop structure fold topology a type of architecture that also have a conserve loop structure block be a conserved amino acid sequence pattern in a family of protein the pattern include a series of possible match at each position in the represented sequence but there be not any inserted or deleted position in the pattern or in the sequence by way of contrast sequence profile be a type of score matrix that represent a similar set of pattern that include insertion and deletion class a term use to classify protein domains accord to their secondary structural content and organization four class be originally recognize by levitt and chothia and several others have be add in the scop database three class be give in the cath database and with the class include both alternate and structure core the portion of a folded protein molecule that comprise the hydrophobic interior of and the compact structure bring together side group of amino acid into close enough proximity so that they can interact when compare protein structure a in the scop database core be the region common to most of the structure that share a common fold or that be in the same superfamily in structure prediction core be sometimes define a the arrangement of secondary structure that be likely to be conserve during evolutionary change domain sequence context a segment of a polypeptide chain that can fold into a structure irrespective of the presence of other segment of the chain the separate domain of a give protein may interact extensively or may be join only by a length of polypeptide chain a protein with several domain may use these domain for functional interaction with different molecule family sequence context a group of protein of similar biochemical function that be more than identical when align this same cutoff be still use by the protein information resource pir a protein family comprise protein with the same function in different organism orthologous sequence but may also include protein in the same organism paralogous sequence derive from gene duplication and rearrangement if a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family reveal a common level of similarity throughout the length of the protein pir refers to the family a a homeomorphic family the aligned region be refer to a a homeomorphic domain and this region may comprise several small homology domain that be share with other family family may be far subdivide into subfamily or group into superfamily base on respective high or low level of sequence similarity the scop database report family and the cath database version beta report when the sequence of protein with the same function be examine in great detail some be find to share high sequence similarity they be obviously member of the same family by the above criterion however others be find that have very little or even insignificant sequence similarity with other family member in such case the family relationship between two distant family member a and c can often be demonstrate by find an additional family member b that share significant similarity with both a and thus b provide a connect link between a and another approach be to examine distant alignment for highly conserve match at a level of identity of protein be likely to have the same structure and the identical atom in the sequence alignment will also superimpose within approximately å in the structural model thus if the structure of one member of a family be know a reliable prediction may be make for a second member of the family and the high the identity level the more reliable the prediction protein structural modeling can be perform by examine how well the amino acid substitution fit into the core of the structure family structural context a use in the fssp database family of structurally similar protein and the web site two structure that have a significant level of structural similarity but not necessarily significant sequence similarity fold similar to structural motif include a large combination of secondary structural unit in the same configuration thus proteins share the same fold have the same combination of secondary structure that be connect by similar loop an example be the rossman fold comprise several alternate α helix and parallel β strand in the scop cath and fssp databases the known protein structure have be classify into hierarchical level of structural complexity with the fold a a basic level of classification homologous domain sequence context an extended sequence pattern generally find by sequence alignment method that indicate a common evolutionary origin among the aligned sequence a homology domain be generally long than motifs the domain may include all of a give protein sequence or only a portion of the sequence some domain be complex and make up of several small homology domain that become join to form a large one during evolution a domain that cover an entire sequence be call the homeomorphic domain by pir protein information resource module a region of conserve amino acid pattern comprise one or more motif and consider to be a fundamental unit of structure or function the presence of a module have also be use to classify protein into family motif sequence context a conserved pattern of amino acid that be find in two or more protein in the prosite catalog a motif be an amino acid pattern that be find in a group of protein that have a similar biochemical activity and that often be near the active site of the protein example of sequence motif database be the prosite catalog and the stanford motifs database motif structural context a combination of several secondary structural element produce by the folding of adjacent section of the polypeptide chain into a specific configuration an example be the motif structural motif be also refer to a supersecondary structure and fold score matrix sequence context also know a weight or score matrix represent a conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment with no gap each matrix column represent the variation find in one column of the multiple sequence alignment score structural context represent the amino acid variation find in an alignment of protein that fall into the same structural class matrix column represent the amino acid variation find at one amino acid position in the aligned structure primary structure the linear amino acid sequence of a protein which chemically be a polypeptide chain compose of amino acid join by peptide bond profile sequence context a score matrix that represent a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family the profile be usually obtain from a region in a multiple sequence alignment the profile be in the form of a matrix with each column represent a position in the alignment and each row one of the amino acid matrix value give the likelihood of each amino acid at the corresponding position in the alignment the profile be move along the target sequence to locate the best scoring region by a dynamic programming algorithm gap be allow during match and a gap penalty be include in this case a a negative score when no amino acid be match a sequence profile may also be represent by a hidden markov model refer to a a profile hmm profile structural context a score matrix that represent which amino acid should fit well and which should fit poorly at sequential position in a known protein structure profile columns represent sequential position in the structure and profile row represent the amino acid a with a sequence profile the structural profile be move along a target sequence to find the high possible alignment score by a dynamic programming algorithm gap may be include and receive a penalty the result score provide an indication a to whether or not the target protein might adopt such a structure quaternary structure the configuration of a protein molecule comprise several independent polypeptide chain secondary structure the interaction that occur between the c o and nh group on amino acid in a polypeptide chain to form turn loop and other form and that facilitate the folding into a structure superfamily a group of protein family of the same or different length that be relate by distant yet detectable sequence similarity member of a give superfamily thus have a common evolutionary origin originally dayhoff define the cutoff for superfamily status a be the chance that the sequence be not relate of on the basis of an alignment score dayhoff et al protein with few identity in an alignment of the sequence but with a convincingly common number of structural and functional feature be place in the same superfamily at the level of structure superfamily protein will share common structural feature such a a common fold but there may also be difference in the number and arrangement of secondary structure the pir resource use the term homeomorphic superfamily to refer to superfamily that be compose of sequence that can be align from end to end represent a sharing of single sequence homology domain a region of similarity that extend throughout the alignment this domain may also comprise small homology domain that be share with other protein family and superfamily although a give protein sequence may contain domain find in several superfamily thus indicate a complex evolutionary history sequence will be assign to only one homeomorphic superfamily base on the presence of similarity throughout a multiple sequence alignment the superfamily alignment may also include region that do not align either within or at the end of the alignment in contrast sequence in the same family align well throughout the alignment supersecondary structure a term with similar meaning to a structural motif tertiary structure be the or globular structure form by the pack together or folding of secondary structure of a polypeptide chain secondary structure prediction be a set of technique in bioinformatics that aim to predict the local secondary structure of protein base only on knowledge of their amino acid sequence for proteins a prediction consist of assign region of the amino acid sequence a likely alpha helix beta strand often note a extended conformation or turn the success of a prediction be determine by compare it to the result of the dssp algorithm or similar stride apply to the crystal structure of the protein specialize algorithm have be develop for the detection of specific pattern such a transmembrane helix and coil coil in proteins the best modern method of secondary structure prediction in protein reach about accuracy this high accuracy allow the use of the prediction a feature improve fold recognition and ab initio protein structure prediction classification of structural motif and refinement of sequence alignment the accuracy of current protein secondary structure prediction method be assess in weekly benchmark such a livebench and eva early method of secondary structure prediction introduce in the and early focus on identify likely alpha helix and be base mainly on transition model significantly more accurate prediction that include beta sheet be introduce in the and rely on statistical assessment base on probability parameter derive from know solved structure these method apply to a single sequence be typically at most about accurate and often underpredict beta sheet the evolutionary conservation of secondary structure can be exploit by simultaneously assess many homologous sequence in a multiple sequence alignment by calculate the net secondary structure propensity of an aligned column of amino acid in concert with large database of know protein structure and modern machine learn method such a neural net and support vector machine these method can achieve up to overall accuracy in globular protein the theoretical upper limit of accuracy be around partly due to idiosyncrasy in dssp assignment near the end of secondary structure where local conformation vary under native condition but may be force to assume a single conformation in crystal due to pack constraint limitation be also impose by secondary structure prediction inability to account for tertiary structure for example a sequence predict a a likely helix may still be able to adopt a conformation if it be locate within a region of the protein and it side chain pack well with their neighbor dramatic conformational change relate to the protein function or environment can also alter local secondary structure to date over different secondary structure prediction method have be develop one of the first algorithm be method which rely predominantly on probability parameter determine from relative frequency of each amino acid appearance in each type of secondary structure the original parameter determine from the small sample of structure solve in the produce poor result compare to modern method though the parameterization have be update since it be first publish the method be roughly accurate in predict secondary structure the next notable program be the gor method name for the three scientist who develop it g arnier o sguthorpe and r obson be an information method it use the more powerful probabilistic technique of bayesian inference the gor method take into account not only the probability of each amino acid have a particular secondary structure but also the conditional probability of the amino acid assume each structure give the contribution of it neighbor it do not assume that the neighbor have that same structure the approach be both more sensitive and more accurate than that of chou and fasman because amino acid structural propensity be only strong for a small number of amino acid such a proline and glycine weak contribution from each of many neighbor can add up to strong effect overall the original gor method be roughly accurate and be dramatically more successful in predict alpha helix than beta sheet which it frequently mispredicted a loop or disorganize region another big step forward be use machine learn method first artificial neural network method be use a a training set they use solved structure to identify common sequence motif associate with particular arrangement of secondary structure these method be over accurate in their prediction although beta strand be still often underpredicted due to the lack of structural information that would allow assessment of hydrogen bonding pattern that can promote formation of the extended conformation require for the presence of a complete beta sheet psipred and jpred be some of the most known program base on neural network for protein secondary structure prediction next support vector machine have prove particularly useful for predict the location of turn which be difficult to identify with statistical method extension of machine learn technique attempt to predict more local property of protein such a backbone dihedral angle in unassigned region both svms and neural network have be apply to this problem more recently torsion angle can be accurately predict by and successfully employ for ab initio structure prediction it be report that in addition to the protein sequence secondary structure formation depend on other factor for example it be report that secondary structure tendency depend also on local environment solvent accessibility of residue protein structural class and even the organism from which the protein be obtain base on such observation some study have show that secondary structure prediction can be improve by addition of information about protein structural class residue accessible surface area and also contact number information the practical role of protein structure prediction be now more important than ever massive amount of protein sequence data be produce by modern dna sequence effort such a the human genome project despite effort in structural genomics the output of experimentally determine protein by and relatively expensive crystallography or nmr lagging far behind the output of protein sequence the protein structure prediction remain an extremely difficult and unresolved undertake the two main problem be calculation of protein free energy and find the global minimum of this energy a protein structure prediction method must explore the space of possible protein structure which be astronomically large these problem can be partially bypass in comparative or homology modeling and fold recognition method in which the search space be prune by the assumption that the protein in question adopts a structure that be close to the experimentally determined structure of another homologous protein on the other hand the de novo or ab initio protein structure prediction method must explicitly resolve these problem the progress and challenge in protein structure prediction have be review in zhang before model most tertiary structure model method such a rosetta be optimize for model the tertiary structure of single protein domains a step call parsing or boundary prediction be usually do first to split a protein into potential structural domain a with the rest of tertiary structure prediction this can be do comparatively from know structure or ab initio with the sequence only usually by machine learning assist by covariation the structure for individual domain be dock together in a process call assembly to form the final tertiary structure ab initio protein and initio or de novo protein model method seek to build protein model from scratch base on physical principle rather than directly on previously solve structure there be many possible procedure that either attempt to mimic protein folding or apply some stochastic method to search possible solution global optimization of a suitable energy function these procedure tend to require vast computational resource and have thus only be carry out for tiny protein to predict protein structure de novo for large protein will require good algorithm and large computational resource like those afford by either powerful supercomputer such a blue gene or or distribute compute such a fold home the human proteome folding project and rosetta home although these computational barrier be vast the potential benefit of structural genomics by predict or experimental method make ab initio structure prediction an active research field a of a protein could be simulate on a supercomputer for millisecond a of comparable sampling could be do on a standard desktop with a new graphic card and more sophisticated algorithm a much large simulation timescales can be achieve use model covariation to predict a sequencing become more commonplace in the several group use protein sequence alignment to predict correlated mutation and it be hop that these coevolved residue could be use to predict tertiary structure use the analogy to distance constraint from experimental procedure such a nmr the assumption be when single residue mutation be slightly deleterious compensatory mutation may occur to restabilize interaction this early work use what be know a local method to calculate correlated mutation from protein sequence but suffer from indirect false correlation which result from treat each pair of residue a independent of all other pair in a different and this time global statistical approach demonstrate that predict coevolved residue be sufficient to predict the fold of a protein provide there be enough sequence available homologous sequence be need the method evfold use no homology model thread or structure fragment and can be run on a standard personal computer even for protein with hundred of residue the accuracy of the contact predict use this and related approach have now be demonstrate on many know structure and contact map include the prediction of experimentally unsolved transmembrane protein protein comparative protein model us previously solve structure a start point or template this be effective because it appear that although the number of actual protein be vast there be a limited set of tertiary structural motif to which most protein belong it have be suggest that there be only around distinct protein fold in nature though there be many million of different protein these method may also be split into two group homology modeling be base on the reasonable assumption that two homologous protein will share very similar structure because a protein fold be more evolutionarily conserve than it amino acid sequence a target sequence can be model with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related template provide that the relationship between target and template can be discern through sequence alignment it have be suggest that the primary bottleneck in comparative modelling arises from difficulty in alignment rather than from error in structure prediction give a alignment unsurprisingly homology modelling be most accurate when the target and template have similar sequence protein thread scan the amino acid sequence of an unknown structure against a database of solved structure in each case a scoring function be use to assess the compatibility of the sequence to the structure thus yield possible model this type of method be also know a fold recognition due to it compatibility analysis between structure and linear protein sequence this method have also give rise to method perform an folding search by evaluate the compatibility of a give structure with a large database of sequence thus predict which sequence have the potential to produce a give fold geometry accurate packing of the amino acid side chain represent a separate problem in protein structure prediction method that specifically address the problem of predict geometry include elimination and the mean field methods the side chain conformation with low energy be usually determine on the rigid polypeptide backbone and use a set of discrete side chain conformation know a rotamers the method attempt to identify the set of rotamers that minimize the model overall energy these method use rotamer library which be collection of favorable conformation for each residue type in protein rotamer library may contain information about the conformation it frequency and the standard deviation about mean dihedral angle which can be use in sample rotamer library be derive from structural bioinformatics or other statistical analysis of conformation in known experimental structure of protein such a by cluster the observed conformation for tetrahedral carbon near the staggered value rotamer library can be or rotamer library make no reference to backbone conformation and be calculate from all available side chain of a certain type for instance the first example of a rotamer library do by ponder and richards at yale in library present different dihedral angle rotamer frequency for or coil secondary structure rotamer library present conformation frequency dependent on the local backbone conformation a define by the backbone dihedral angle and regardless of secondary structure the modern version of these library a use in most software be present a multidimensional distribution of probability or frequency where the peak correspond to the conformation consider a individual rotamers in the list some version be base on very carefully curated data and be use primarily for structure validation while others emphasize relative frequency in much large data set and be the form use primarily for structure prediction such a the dunbrack rotamer library pack method be most useful for analyze the protein hydrophobic core where side chain be more closely pack they have more difficulty address the looser constraint and high flexibility of surface residue which often occupy multiple rotamer conformation rather than just one prediction of structural class statistical method have be develop for predict structural class of protein base on their amino acid composition pseudo amino acid composition and functional domain composition secondary structure predicion also implicitly generate such a prediction for singular domain in the case of complex of two or more protein where the structure of the protein be know or can be predict with high accuracy dock method can be use to predict the structure of the complex information of the effect of mutation at specific site on the affinity of the complex help to understand the complex structure and to guide dock method a great number of software tool for protein

quotient of the verma module by it maximal submodule a verma module be irreducible if and only if it have no singular vector a vector or vector of a high weight representation be a state that be both descendent and primary a sufficient condition for the verma module to have a singular vector at the level be for some positive integer such that with in particular and the reducible verma module have a singular vector at the level then and the corresponding reducible verma module have a singular vector at the level this condition for the existence of a singular vector at the level be not necessary in particular there be a singular vector at the level if with and this singular vector be now a descendent of another singular vector at the level this type of singular vector can however only exist if the central charge be of the type for coprime these be the central charge of the minimal model form and a high weight representation with a real value of have a unique hermitian form such that the adjoint of be and the norm of the primary state be one the representation be call if that hermitian form be positive definite since any singular vector have zero norm all unitary high weight

irreducible quotient be this expression be an infinite sum because the submodules and have a nontrivial intersection which be itself a complicated submodule field in two dimension the algebra of local conformal transformation be make of two copy of the witt algebra it follow that the symmetry algebra of conformal field theory be the virasoro algebra technically the conformal bootstrap approach to cft relies on virasoro conformal block special function that include and generalize the character of representation of the virasoro algebra since the virasoro algebra comprise the generator of the conformal group of the worldsheet the stress tensor in string theory obeys the commutation relation of two copy of the virasoro algebra this be because the conformal group decompose into separate diffeomorphisms of the forward and back lightcones diffeomorphism invariance of the worldsheet implies additionally that the stress tensor vanishes this be know a the virasoro constraint and in the quantum theory can not be apply to all the state in the theory but rather only on the physical state compare formalism virasoro there be two supersymmetric extension of the virasoro algebra call the

a soliton or toron occurs when two adjoin structure or space be in some way out of phase with each other in way that make a seamless transition between them impossible one of the simple and most commonplace example of a topological soliton occur in coiled telephone handset cord which be usually coil clockwise year of pick up the handset can end up coil part of the cord in the opposite counterclockwise direction and when this happen there will be a distinctive large loop that separate the two direction of coil this odd look transition loop which be neither clockwise nor counterclockwise be an excellent example of a topological soliton no matter how complex the context anything that qualify a a topological soliton must at some level exhibit this same simple issue of reconciliation see in the twisted phone cord example topological soliton arise with ease when create the crystalline semiconductor use in modern electronics and in that context their effect be almost always deleterious for this reason such crystal transition be call defect however this mostly terminology distracts from the rich and intriguing mathematical property of such boundary region thus for most contexts the more positive and mathematically rich phrase topological soliton be preferable a more detailed discussion of topological soliton and related topic be provide below in mathematics and physic a soliton or a defect be a solution of a system of partial differential equation or of a quantum field theory homotopically distinct from the vacuum solution the existence of a topological defect can be demonstrate whenever the boundary condition entail the existence of homotopically distinct solution typically this occur because the boundary on which the condition be specify have a homotopy group which be preserve in differential equation the solution to the differential equation be then topologically distinct and be classify by their homotopy class topological defect be not only stable against small perturbation but can not decay or be undone or be precisely because there be no continuous transformation that will map them homotopically to a uniform or trivial solution topological defect occur in partial differential equation and be believe to drive phase transition in condensed matter physic the authenticity of a topological defect depend on the nature of the vacuum in which the system will tend towards if infinite time elapse false and true topological defect can be distinguish if the defect be in a false vacuum and a true vacuum respectively wave example include the soliton or solitary wave which occur in exactly solvable model such a dislocation in crystalline material in quantum field theory and defect of the model topological defect in lambda transition universality class system include in liquid crystal flux tubes know a fluxons in superconductors and in superfluids topological defect of the cosmological type be extremely phenomena which be deem impractical to produce in physic experiment topological defect create during the universe formation could theoretically be observe without significant energy expenditure in the big bang theory the universe cool from an initial hot dense state trigger a series of phase transition much like what happen in system such a superconductors certain grand unified theory predict the formation of stable topological defect in the early universe during these phase transition depend on the nature of symmetry breakdown various soliton be believe to have form in the early universe accord to the mechanism the topological defect be string be line that form when an axial or cylindrical symmetry be break wall membrane that form when a discrete symmetry be break at a phase transition these wall resemble the wall of a foam divide the universe into discrete cell defect that form when a spherical symmetry be break be predict to have magnetic charge either north or south and so be commonly call magnetic monopoles form when large more complicated symmetry group be completely broken they be not as localize a the other defect and be unstable dimension and high dimension other more complex hybrid of these defect type be also possible a the universe expand and cool symmetry in the law of physic begin break down in region that spread at the speed of light topological defect occur at the boundary of adjacent region the matter compose these boundary be in an ordered phase which persist after the phase transition to the disordered phase be complete for the surrounding region defect have also be find in biochemistry notably in the process of protein fold an ordered medium be define a a region of space describe by a function f r that assign to every point in the region an order parameter and the possible value of the order parameter space constitute an order parameter space the homotopy theory of defect use the fundamental group of the order parameter space of a medium to discuss the existence stability and classification of topological defect in that medium suppose r be the order parameter space for a medium and let g be a lie group of transformation on r let h be the symmetry subgroup of g for the medium then the order parameter space can be write a the lie group quotient r g h if g be a universal cover for g h then it can be show that π n g h π n h where π i denote the i homotopy group various type of defect in the medium can be characterize by element of various homotopy group of the order parameter space for example in three dimension line defect correspond to element of r point defect correspond to element of r texture correspond to element of r however defect which belong to the same conjugacy class of r can be deform continuously to each other and hence distinct defect correspond to distinct conjugacy class poénaru and toulouse show that cross defect get entangle if and only if they be member of separate conjugacy class of r topological defect have not be observe by astronomer however certain type be not compatible with current observation in particular if domain wall and monopoles be present in the observable universe they would result in significant deviation from what astronomer can see because of these observation the formation of defect within the observable universe be highly constrain require special circumstance see inflation cosmology on the other hand cosmic string have be suggest a provide the initial around which the structure of the cosmos of matter have condense texture be similarly benign in late a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background provide evidence of a possible texture class of stable defect in biaxial nematics in condensed matter physic the theory of homotopy group provide a natural setting for description and classification of defect in ordered system topological method have be use in several problem of condensed matter theory poénaru and toulouse use topological method to obtain a condition for line string defect in liquid crystal that can cross each other without entanglement it be a application of topology that first lead to the discovery of peculiar hydrodynamic behavior in the a of superfluid homotopy theory be deeply relate to the stability of topological defect in the case of line defect if the closed path can be continuously deform into one point the defect be not stable and otherwise it be stable unlike in cosmology and field theory topological defect in condensed matter have be experimentally observed ferromagnetic material have region of magnetic alignment separate by domain wall nematic and nematic liquid crystal display a variety of defect include monopoles string texture etc a static solution to in spacetime a soliton and an antisoliton collide with velocity and annihilate condensed matter differential equation dislocation quantum mechanic quantum topology quantum vortex topological entropy in physic topological

a field theory be a quantum field theory that be invariant under conformal transformation in two dimension there be an algebra of local conformal transformation and conformal field theory can sometimes be exactly solve or classify conformal field theory have important application to condensed matter physic statistical mechanic quantum statistical mechanic and string theory statistical and condensed matter system be indeed often conformally invariant at their thermodynamic or quantum critical point in quantum field theory scale invariance be a common and natural symmetry because any fixed point of the renormalization group be by definition scale invariant conformal symmetry be strong than scale invariance and one need additional assumption to argue that it should appear in nature the basic idea behind it plausibility be that local scale invariant theory have their current give by where be a kill vector and be a conserved operator the of dimension exactly for the associated symmetry to include scale but not conformal transformation the trace have to be a total derivative implying that there be a operator of dimension exactly under some assumption it be possible to completely rule out this type of and hence prove that scale invariance implies conformal invariance in a quantum field theory for example in unitary compact conformal field theory in two dimension while it be possible for a quantum field theory to be scale invariant but not conformally invariant example be rare for this reason the term be often use interchangeably in the context of quantum field theory the number of independent conformal transformation be infinite in two dimension and finite in high dimension this make conformal symmetry much more constraining in two dimension all conformal field theory share the idea and technique of the conformal bootstrap but the resulting equation be more powerful in two dimension where they be sometimes exactly solvable for example in the case of minimal model than in high dimension where numerical approach dominate the development of conformal field theory have be earlier and deeper in the case in particular after the article by belavin polyakov and zamolodchikov the term conformal field theory have sometimes be use with the meaning of conformal field theory a in the title of a textbook conformal field theory have become more popular with the correspondence in the late and the development of numerical conformal bootstrap technique in the global v local conformal symmetry in two dimension the global conformal group of the riemann sphere be the group of möbius transformation which be on the other hand infinitesimal conformal transformation form the witt algebra the conformal killing equation in two dimension reduce to just the equation the infinity of mode of arbitrary analytic coordinate transformation yield the infinity of kill vector field strictly speak it be possible for a conformal field theory to be local in the sense of possess a while still only exhibit invariance under the global this turn out to be unique to theories an example be the biharmonic scalar this property should be view a even more special than scale without conformal invariance a it require to be a total second derivative global conformal symmetry in two dimension be a special case of conformal symmetry in high dimension and be study with the same technique this be do not only in theory that have global but not local conformal symmetry but also in theory that do have local conformal symmetry for the purpose of test technique or idea from cft in particular numerical bootstrap technique can be test by apply them to minimal model and compare the result with the know analytic result that follow from local conformal symmetry conformal field theory with a virasoro symmetry algebra in a conformally invariant quantum theory the witt algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformation have to be centrally extend the quantum symmetry algebra be therefore the virasoro algebra which depend on a number call the charge this central extension can also be understand in term of a conformal anomaly it be show by alexander zamolodchikov that there exist a function which decrease monotonically under the renormalization group flow of a quantum field theory and be equal to the central charge for a conformal field theory this be know a the zamolodchikov and tell u that renormalization group flow in two dimension be irreversible in addition to be centrally extend the symmetry algebra of a conformally invariant quantum theory have to be complexified result in two copy of the virasoro algebra in euclidean cft these copy be call holomorphic and antiholomorphic in lorentzian cft they be call and right move both copy have the same central charge the space of state of a theory be a representation of the product of the two virasoro algebra this space be a hilbert space if the theory be unitary this space may contain a vacuum state or in statistical mechanic a thermal state unless the central charge vanishes there can not exist a state that leave the entire infinite dimensional conformal symmetry unbroken the best we can have be a state that be invariant under the generator of the virasoro algebra whose basis be this contain the generator of the global conformal transformation the rest of the conformal group be spontaneously broken and for a give spacetime and metric a conformal transformation be a transformation that preserve angle we will focus on conformal transformation of the flat euclidean space or of the minkowski space if be a conformal transformation the jacobian be of the form where be the scale factor and be a rotation an orthogonal matrix or lorentz tranformation the conformal group be locally isomorphic to euclidean or minkowski this include translation rotation euclidean or lorentz transformation minkowski and dilation scale transformation this also include special conformal transformation for any translation there be a conformal transformation where be the such that in the sphere the inversion exchange with translation leave fix while special conformal transformation leave fix the commutation relation of the corresponding lie algebra be where generate translation generates dilation generate special conformal transformation and generate rotation or lorentz transformation the tensor be the flat metric issue in minkowski in minkowski space the conformal group do not preserve causality observables such a correlation function be invariant under the conformal algebra but not under the conformal group a show by lüscher and mack it be possible to restore the invariance under the conformal group by extend the flat minkowski space into a lorentzian cylinder the original minkowski space be conformally equivalent to a region of the cylinder call a poincaré patch in the cylinder global conformal transformation do not violate causality instead they can move point outside the poincaré patch in the conformal bootstrap approach a conformal field theory be a set of correlation function that obey a number of axiom the correlation function be a function of the position and other parameter of the field in the bootstrap approach the field themselves make sense only in the context of correlation function and may be view a efficient notation for write axiom for correlation function correlation function depend linearly on field in particular we focus on cft on the euclidean space in this case correlation function be schwinger function they be define for and do not depend on the order of the field in minkowski space correlation function be wightman function they can depend on the order of the field a field commute only if they be spacelike separate a euclidean cft can be relate to a minkowskian cft by wick rotation for example thanks to the theorem in such case minkowskian correlation function be obtain from euclidean correlation function by an analytic continuation that depend on the order of the field behaviour under conformal transformation any conformal transformation act linearly on field such that be a representation of the conformal group and correlation function be invariant primary field be field that transform into themselves via the behaviour of a primary field be characterize by a number call it dimension and a representation of the rotation or lorentz group for a primary field we then have here and be the scale factor and rotation that be associate to the conformal transformation the representation be trivial in the case of scalar field which transform a for vector field the representation be the fundamental representation and we would have a primary field that be characterize by the conformal dimension and representation behaves a a vector in an induced representation of the conformal group from the subgroup generate by dilation and rotation in particular the conformal dimension characterize a representation of the subgroup of dilation in two dimension the fact that this induced representation be a verma module appear throughout the literature for cfts in which the maximally compact subalgebra be large than the cartan subalgebra it have recently be appreciate that this representation be a parabolic or generalize verma module derivative of any order of primary field be call field their behaviour under conformal transformation be more complicated for example if be a primary field then be a linear combination of and correlation function of descendant field can be deduce from correlation function of primary field however even in the common case where all field be either primary or descendant thereof descendant field play an important role because conformal block and operator product expansion involve sum over all descendant field the collection of all primary field characterize by their scaling dimension and the representation be call the of the theory on field the invariance of correlation function under conformal transformation severely constrain their dependence on field position in the case of and function that dependence be determine up to finitely many constant coefficient function have more freedom and be only determine up to function of conformally invariant combination of the position the function of two primary field vanishes if their conformal dimension differ if the dilation operator be diagonalizable if the theory be not logarithmic there exist a basis of primary field such that function be diagonal in this case the function of a scalar primary field be where we choose the normalization of the field such that the constant coefficient which be not determine by conformal symmetry be one similarly function of primary field be determine up to a coefficient which can be set to one in the case of a symmetric traceless tensor of rank the function be where the tensor be define a the function of three scalar primary field be where and be a structure constant with primary field that be not necessarily scalars conformal symmetry allow a finite number of tensor structure and there be a structure constant for each tensor structure in the case of two scalar field and a symmetric traceless tensor of rank there be only one tensor structure and the function be where we introduce the vector function of scalar primary field be determine up to arbitrary function of the two the function be then operator product expansion the operator product expansion ope be more powerful in conformal field theory than in more general quantum field theory this be because in conformal field theory the operator product expansion radius of convergence be finite it be not zero provide the position of two field be close enough the operator product expansion rewrite the product of these two field a a linear combination of field at a give point which can be choose a for technical convenience the operator product expansion of two field take the form where be some coefficient function and the sum in principle run over all field in the theory equivalently by the correspondence the sum run over all state in the space of state some field may actually be absent in particular due to constraint from symmetry conformal symmetry or extra symmetry if all field be primary or descendant the sum over field can be reduce to a sum over primary by rewrite the contribution of any descendant in term of the contribution of the corresponding primary where the field be all primary and be the structure constant which for this reason be also call coefficient the differential operator be an infinite series in derivative which be determine by conformal symmetry and therefore in principle know view the ope a a relation between correlation function show that the ope must be associative furthermore if the space be euclidean the ope must be commutative because correlation function do not depend on the order of the field the existence of the operator product expansion be a fundamental axiom of the conformal bootstrap however it be generally not necessary to compute operator product expansion and in particular the differential operator rather it be the decomposition of correlation function into structure constant and conformal block that be need the ope can in principle be use for compute conformal block but in practice there be more efficient method conformal block and cross symmetry use the ope a function can be write a a combination of structure constant and conformal block the conformal block be the sum of the contribution of the primary field and it descendant it depend on the field and their position if the function or involve several independent tensor structure the structure constant and conformal block depend on these tensor structure and the primary field contribute several independent block conformal block be determine by conformal symmetry and know in principle to compute them there be recursion relation and integrable technique use the ope or the same function be write in term of conformal block or conformal block the equality of the and decomposition be call symmetry a constraint on the spectrum of primary field and on the structure constants conformal block obey the same conformal symmetry constraint a function in particular conformal block can be write in term of function of the while the ope only converge if conformal block can be analytically continue to all non pairwise coincide value of the position and the decomposition into conformal block converge whenever the four point do not lie on the same circle however conformal block be not function of the position and in general have nontrivial monodromies when point move around one another a conformal field theory in flat euclidean space be thus define by it spectrum and ope coefficient or structure constant satisfy the constraint that all function be from the spectrum and ope coefficient collectively refer to a the data correlation function of arbitrary order can be compute unitarity a conformal field theory be if it space of state have a positive definite scalar product such that the dilation operator be then the scalar product endow the space of state with the structure of a hilbert space in euclidean conformal field theory unitarity be equivalent to positivity of correlation function one of the axiom unitarity imply that the conformal dimension of primary field be real and bound from below the low bound depend on the spacetime dimension and on the representation of the rotation or lorentz group in which the primary field transforms for scalar field the unitarity bound be in a unitary theory structure constant must be real which in turn implies that function obey certain inequality powerful numerical bootstrap method be base on exploit these inequality compactness a conformal field theory be if it obey three condition all conformal dimension be real for any there be finitely many state whose dimension be less than there be a unique state with the dimension and it be the state the corresponding field be the field the identity field be the field whose insertion into correlation function do not modify them the name come from the fact that if a conformal field theory be also a sigma model it will satisfy these condition if and only if it target space be compact it be believe that all unitary conformal field theory be compact in dimension without unitarity on the other hand it be possible to find cfts in dimension four and in dimension that have a continuous spectrum and in dimension two liouville theory be unitary but not compact extra symmetry a conformal field theory may have extra symmetry in addition to conformal symmetry for example the ising model have a symmetry and superconformal field theory have supersymmetry mean field theory a free field be a field whose correlation function be deduce from it function by wick theorem for instance if be a scalar primary field of dimension it function read for instance if be two scalar primary field such that which be the case in particular if we have the function mean field theory be a generic name for conformal field theory that be build from generalize free field for example a mean field theory can be build from one scalar primary field then this theory contain it descendant field and the field that appear in the ope the primary field that appear in can be determine by decompose the function in conformal block their conformal dimension belong to similarly it be possible to construct mean field theory start from a field with lorentz spin for example the maxwell theory in the absence of charge matter field be a mean field theory build out of an antisymmetric tensor field with scale dimension critical ising model the ising model be the critical point of the ising model on a hypercubic lattice in two or three dimension it have a global symmetry correspond to flip all spin the critical ising model include the virasoro minimal model which can be solve exactly there be no ising cft in dimension critical potts model the potts model with color be a unitary cft that be invariant under the permutation group it be a generalization of the critical ising model which correspond to the critical potts model exist in a range of dimension depend on the critical potts model may be construct a the continuum limit of the potts model on d hypercubic lattice in the reformulation in term of cluster the potts model can be define for but it be not unitary if be not integer critical o n model the o n model be a cft invariant under the orthogonal group for any integer it exist a a interacting unitary and compact cft in dimension and for also in two dimension it be a generalization of the critical ising model which correspond to the o n cft at the o n cft can be construct a the continuum limit of a lattice model with spin that be n discuss here alternatively the critical model can be construct a the limit of fixed point in dimension at the fixed point become the tensor product of free scalar with dimension for the model in question be when n be large the o n model can be solve perturbatively in a expansion by mean of the transformation in particular the limit of the critical o n model be conformal gauge theory some conformal field theory in three and four dimension admit a lagrangian description in the form of a gauge theory either abelian or example of such cfts be qed with sufficiently many charge field in or

in mathematics the be a space that parameterizes all linear subspace of the vector space for example the grassmannian be the space of line through the origin in so it be the same a the projective space of one dimension low than when be a real or complex vector space grassmannians be compact smooth manifold in general they have the structure of a smooth algebraic variety of dimension the early work on a grassmannian be due to julius plücker who study the set of projective line in projective equivalent to and parameterized them by what be now call plücker coordinate hermann grassmann later introduce the concept in general notation vary between author with be equivalent to and some author use or to denote the grassmannian of subspace of an unspecified vector space by give a collection of subspace of some vector space a topological structure it be possible to talk about a continuous choice of subspace or open and close collection of subspace by give them the structure of a differential manifold one can talk about smooth choice of subspace a natural example come from tangent bundle of smooth manifold embed in euclidean space suppose we have a manifold of dimension embed in at each point in the tangent space to can be consider a a subspace of the tangent space of which be just the map assign to it tangent space define a map from to in order to do this we have to translate the tangent space at each so that it pass through the origin rather than and hence defines a vector subspace this idea be very similar to the gauss map for surface in a space this idea can with some effort be extend to all vector bundle over a manifold so that every vector bundle generate a continuous map from to a suitably generalise various embed theorem must be prove to show this we then find that the property of our vector bundle be relate to the property of the corresponding map view a continuous map in particular we find that vector bundle induce homotopic map to the grassmannian be isomorphic here the definition of homotopic relies on a notion of continuity and hence a topology for the grassmannian be the space of line through the origin in so it be the same a the projective space of dimension for the grassmannian be the space of all plane contain the origin in euclidean a plane contain the origin be completely characterize by the one and only line through the origin that be perpendicular to that plane and vice versa hence the space and the projective plane may all be identify with each other the simple grassmannian that be not a projective space be which may be parameterized via plücker coordinate let be an vector space over a field the grassmannian be the set of all linear subspace of the grassmannian be also denote or to endow the grassmannian with the structure of a differentiable manifold choose a basis for this be equivalent to identify it with with the standard basis denote view a column vector then for any subspace view a an element of we may choose a basis consisting of linearly independent column vector the homogeneous coordinate of the element consist of the component of the rectangular matrix of maximal rank whose th column vector be since the choice of basis be arbitrary two such maximal rank rectangular matrix and represent the same element if and only if for some element of the general linear group of invertible matrix with entry in now we define a coordinate atlas for any matrix we can apply elementary column operation to obtain it reduced column echelon form if the first row of be linearly independent the result will have the form the matrix determine in general the first row need not be independent but for any whose rank be there exist an ordered set of integer such that the submatrix consisting of the row of be nonsingular we may apply column operation to reduce this submatrix to the identity and the remain entry uniquely correspond to hence we have the following definition for each ordered set of integer let be the set of matrix whose submatrix be nonsingular where the th row of be the th row of the coordinate function on be then define a the map that send to the rectangular matrix whose row be the row of the matrix complementary to the choice of homogeneous coordinate matrix represent the element do not affect the value of the coordinate matrix represent on the coordinate neighbourhood moreover the coordinate matrix may take arbitrary value and they define a diffeomorphism from onto the space of matrix on the overlap of any two such coordinate neighborhood the coordinate matrix value be relate by the transition relation where both and be invertible hence give an atlas of the quick way of give the grassmannian a geometric structure be to express it a a homogeneous space first recall that the general linear group act transitively on the subspace of therefore if be the stabilizer of any of the subspace under this action we have if the underlying field be or and be consider a a lie group then this construction make the grassmannian into a smooth manifold it also become possible to use other group to make this construction to do this fix an inner product on over one replaces by the orthogonal group and by restrict to orthonormal frames one get the identity in particular the dimension of the grassmannian be over one replaces by the unitary group this show that the grassmannian be compact these construction also make the grassmannian into a metric space for a subspace of let be the projection of onto then where denote the operator norm be a metric on the exact inner product use do not matter because a different inner product will give an equivalent norm on and so give an equivalent metric if the ground field be arbitrary and be consider a an algebraic group then this construction show that the grassmannian be a algebraic variety it follow from the existence of the plücker embed that the grassmannian be complete a an algebraic variety in particular be a parabolic subgroup of in the realm of algebraic geometry the grassmannian can be construct a a scheme by express it a a representable functor let be a sheaf on a scheme fix a positive integer then to each the grassmannian functor associate the set of quotient module of locally free of rank on we denote this set by this functor be representable by a separate the latter be projective if be finitely generate when be the spectrum of a field then the sheaf be give by a vector space and we recover the usual grassmannian variety of the dual space of namely by construction the grassmannian scheme be compatible with base change for any we have a canonical isomorphism in particular for any point of the canonical morphism induce an isomorphism from the fiber to the usual grassmannian over the residue field since the grassmannian scheme represent a functor it come with a universal object which be an object of and therefore a quotient module of locally free of rank over the quotient homomorphism induce a closed immersion from the projective bundle for any morphism of this closed immersion induce a closed immersion conversely any such closed immersion come from a surjective homomorphism of from to a locally free module of rank therefore the element of be exactly the projective subbundles of rank in under this identification when be the spectrum of a field and be give by a vector space the set of rational point correspond to the projective linear subspace of dimension in and the image of in be the set the plücker embedding be a natural embedding of the grassmannian

in physic phenomenon be the collective name associate with the physic of critical point most of them stem from the divergence of the correlation length but also the dynamic slow down critical phenomenon include scaling relation among different quantity divergence of some quantity such a the magnetic susceptibility in the ferromagnetic phase transition describe by critical exponent universality fractal behaviour and ergodicity break critical phenomenon take place in second order phase transition although not exclusively the critical behavior be usually different from the approximation which be valid away from the phase transition since the latter neglect correlation which become increasingly important a the system approach the critical point where the correlation length diverge many property of the critical behavior of a system can be derive in the framework of the renormalization group in order to explain the physical origin of these phenomenon we shall use the ising model a a pedagogical example consider a square array of classical spin which may only take two position and at a certain temperature interact through the ising classical hamiltonian where the sum be extend over the pair of near neighbour and be a coupling constant which we will consider to be fix there be a certain temperature call the curie temperature or critical temperature below which the system present ferromagnetic long range order above it it be paramagnetic and be apparently disorder at temperature zero the system may only take one global sign either or at high temperature but below the state be still globally magnetize but cluster of the opposite sign appear a the temperature increase these cluster start to contain small cluster themselves in a typical russian doll picture their typical size call the correlation length grow with temperature until it diverge at this mean that the whole system be such a cluster and there be no global magnetization above that temperature the system be globally disorder but with ordered cluster within it whose size be again call correlation length but it be now decrease with temperature at infinite temperature it be again zero with the system fully disorder the correlation length diverges at the critical point a this divergence pose no physical problem other physical observables diverge at this point lead to some confusion at the begin the most important be susceptibility let u apply a very small magnetic field to the system in the critical point a very small magnetic field be not able to magnetize a large coherent cluster but with these fractal cluster the picture change it affect easily the small size cluster since they have a nearly paramagnetic behaviour but this change in it turn affect the cluster and the perturbation climb the ladder until the whole system change radically thus critical system be very sensitive to small change in the environment other observables such a the specific heat may also diverge at this point all these divergence stem from that of the correlation length a we approach the critical point these diverge observables behave a for some exponent where typically the value of the exponent α be the same above and below tc these exponent be call critical exponent and be robust observables even more they take the same value for very different physical system this intriguing phenomenon call universality be explain qualitatively and also quantitatively by the renormalization group critical phenomenon may also appear for dynamic quantity not only for static one in fact the divergence of the characteristic time of a system be directly relate to the divergence of the thermal correlation length by the introduction of a dynamical exponent z and the relation the voluminous static universality class of a system split into different le voluminous dynamic universality class with different value of z but a common static critical behaviour and by approach the critical point one may observe all kind of phenomena ergodicity be the assumption that a system at a give temperature explore the full phase space just each state take different probability in an ising ferromagnet below this do not happen if never mind how close they be the system have choose a global magnetization and the phase space be divide into two region from one of them it be impossible to reach the other unless a magnetic field be apply or temperature be raise above see also superselection sector the main mathematical tool to study critical point be renormalization group which take advantage of the russian dolls picture or the to explain universality and predict numerically the critical exponent and variational perturbation theory which convert divergent perturbation expansion into convergent expansion relevant to critical phenomenon in system conformal field theory be a powerful tool which have discover many new property of critical system employ the fact that scale invariance along with a few other requisite lead to an infinite symmetry group the critical point be describe by a conformal field theory accord to the renormalization group theory the define property of criticality be that the characteristic length scale of the structure of the physical system also know a the correlation length ξ become infinite this can happen along critical line in phase space this effect be the cause of the critical opalescence that can be observe a a binary fluid mixture approach it critical point in system in equilibrium the critical point be reach only by precisely tune a control parameter however in some system the critical point be an attractor of the dynamic in a manner that be robust with respect to system parameter a phenomenon refer to a criticality application arise in physic and chemistry but also in field such a sociology for example it be natural to describe a system of two political party by an ising model thereby at a transition from one majority to

in classical statistical mechanic the h introduce by ludwig boltzmann in describe the tendency to decrease in the quantity h define below in a gas of translation a this quantity h be mean to represent the entropy of thermodynamics the h be an early demonstration of the power of statistical mechanic a it claim to derive the second law of statement about fundamentally irreversible reversible microscopic mechanic it be think to prove the second law of thermodynamics albeit under the assumption of initial condition the h be a natural consequence of the kinetic equation derive by boltzmann that have come to be know a boltzmann equation the h have lead to considerable discussion about it actual implication with major theme be what be entropy in what sense do boltzmann quantity h correspond to the thermodynamic entropy be the assumption especially the assumption of molecular chaos behind boltzmann equation too strong when be these assumption violate boltzmann in his original publication write the symbol e a in entropy for it statistical function year later samuel hawksley burbury one of the critic of the theorem write the function with the symbol h a notation that be subsequently adopt by boltzmann when refer to his theorem the notation have lead to some confusion regard the name of the theorem even though the statement be usually refer to a the theorem sometimes it be instead call the theorem a the capital greek letter eta η be undistinguishable from the capital version of latin letter h h discussion have be raise on how the symbol should be understood but it remain unclear due to the lack of write source from the time of the theorem study of the typography and the work of gibbs seem to favour the interpretation of h a eta the h value be determine from the function f e t de which be the energy distribution function of molecule at time t the value f e t de be the number of molecule that have kinetic energy between e and e de itself be define a for an isolated ideal gas with fixed total energy and fixed total number of particle the function h be at a minimum when the particle have a distribution if the molecule of the ideal gas be distribute in some other way say all have the same kinetic energy then the value of h will be high boltzmann h describe in the next section show that when collision between molecule be allow such distribution be unstable and tend to irreversibly seek towards the minimum value of h towards the distribution note on notation boltzmann originally use the letter e for quantity h most of the literature after boltzmann use the letter h a here boltzmann also use the symbol x to refer to the kinetic energy of a particle in this mechanical model of a gas the motion of the molecule appear very disorderly boltzmann show that assume each collision configuration in a gas be truly random and independent the gas converge to the maxwell speed distribution even if it do not start out that way boltzmann consider what happen during the collision between two particle it be a basic fact of mechanic that in the elastic collision between two particle such a hard spheres the energy transfer between the particle varies depend on initial condition angle of collision boltzmann make a key assumption know a the stosszahlansatz molecular chaos assumption that during any collision event in the gas the two particle participate in the collision have independently choose kinetic energy from the distribution independent velocity direction independent start point under these assumption and give the mechanic of energy transfer the energy of the particle after the collision will obey a certain new random distribution that can be compute consider repeat uncorrelated collision between any and all of the molecule in the gas boltzmann construct his kinetic equation boltzmann equation from this kinetic equation a natural outcome be that the continual process of collision cause the quantity h to decrease until it have reach a minimum although boltzmann h turn out not to be the absolute proof of the second law of thermodynamics a originally claim see criticism below the h lead boltzmann in the last year of the century to more and more probabilistic argument about the nature of thermodynamics the probabilistic view of thermodynamics culminate in with josiah willard gibbs statistical mechanic for fully general system not just gas and the introduction of generalized statistical ensembles the kinetic equation and in particular boltzmann molecular chaos assumption inspire a whole family of boltzmann equation that be still use today to model the motion of particle such a the electron in a semiconductor in many case the molecular chaos assumption be highly accurate and the ability to discard complex correlation between particle make calculation much simple the process of thermalisation can be describe use the or the relaxation theorem there be several notable reason describe below why the h at least in it original form be not completely rigorous a boltzmann would eventually go on to admit the arrow of time in the h be not in fact purely mechanical but really a consequence of assumption about initial condition loschmidt paradox soon after boltzmann publish his h theorem johann josef loschmidt object that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from dynamic and a formalism if the h decrease over time in one state then there must be a matching reverse state where h increase over time loschmidt paradox the explanation be that boltzmann equation be base on the assumption of molecular chaos that it follow from or at least be consistent with the underlie kinetic model that the particle be consider independent and uncorrelated it turn out that this assumption break time reversal symmetry in a subtle sense and therefore beg the question once the particle be allow to collide their velocity direction and position in fact do become correlated however these correlation be encode in an extremely complex manner this show that an ongoing assumption of independence be not consistent with the underlie particle model boltzmann reply to loschmidt be to concede the possibility of these state but note that these sort of state be so rare and unusual a to be impossible in practice boltzmann would go on to sharpen this notion of the rarity of state result in his famous equation his entropy formula of see boltzmann entropy formula spin echo a a demonstration of loschmidt paradox a famous modern counter example not to boltzmann original h but to a closely related analogue be the phenomenon of spin echo in the spin echo effect it be physically possible to induce time reversal in an interacting system of spin an analogue to boltzmann h for the spin system can be define in term of the distribution of spin state in the system in the experiment the spin system be initially perturb into a state high h and a predict by the h theorem the quantity h soon decrease to the equilibrium value at some point a carefully construct electromagnetic pulse be apply that reverse the motion of all the spin the spin then undo the time evolution from before the pulse and after some time the h actually increase away from equilibrium once the evolution have completely unwound the h decrease once again to the minimum value in some sense the time reverse state note by loschmidt turn out to be not completely impractical poincaré recurrence in ernst zermelo note a further problem with the h theorem which be that if the system h be at any time not a minimum then by poincaré recurrence the h must recur though after some extremely long time boltzmann admit that these recur rise in h technically would occur but point out that over long times the system spend only a tiny fraction of it time in one of these recur state the second law of thermodynamics state that the entropy of an isolated system always increase to a maximum equilibrium value this be strictly true only in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of particle for a finite number of particle there will always be entropy fluctuation for example in the fixed volume of the isolated system the maximum entropy be obtain when half the particle be in one half of the volume half in the other but sometimes there will be temporarily a few more particle on one side than the other and this will constitute a very small reduction in entropy these entropy fluctuation be such that the long one wait the large an entropy fluctuation one will probably see during that time and the time one must wait for a give entropy fluctuation be always finite even for a fluctuation to it minimum possible value for example one might have an extremely low entropy condition of all particle be in one half of the container the gas will quickly attain it equilibrium value of entropy but give enough time this same situation will happen again for practical system a gas in a container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure this time be truly enormous many multiple of the age of the universe and practically speak one can ignore the possibility fluctuation of h in small system since h be a mechanically define variable that be not conserve then like any other such variable pressure etc it will show thermal fluctuation this mean that h regularly show spontaneous increase from the minimum value technically this be not an exception to the h theorem since the h theorem be only intend to apply for a gas with a very large number of particle these fluctuation be only perceptible when the system be small and the time interval over which it be observe be not enormously large if h be interpret as entropy a boltzmann intend then this can be see a a manifestation of the fluctuation theorem be a forerunner of shannon information entropy claude shannon denote his measure of information entropy h after the the article on shannon information entropy contain an explanation of the discrete counterpart of the quantity h know a the information entropy or information uncertainty with a minus sign by extend the discrete information entropy to the continuous information entropy also call differential entropy one obtain the expression in the equation from the section above definition and meaning of boltzmann h and thus a good feel for the meaning of h the h connection between information and entropy play a central role in a recent controversy call the black hole information paradox richard tolman book the principle of statistical mechanic dedicate a whole chapter to the study of boltzmann h theorem and it extension in the generalized classical statistical mechanic of gibbs a further chapter be devote to the quantum mechanical version of the h classical mechanical we let and be our generalized coordinate for a set of particle then we consider a function that return the probability density of particle over the state in phase space note how this can be multiply by a small region in phase space denote by to yield the average expect number of particle in that region tolman offer the following equation for the definition of the quantity h in boltzmann original h theorem here we sum over the region into which phase space be divide indexed by and in the limit for an infinitesimal phase space volume we can write the sum a an integral can also be write in term of the number of molecule present in each of the cell an additional way to calculate the quantity h be where p be the probability of find a system choose at random from the specified microcanonical ensemble it can finally be write a where g be the number of classical state the quantity h can also be define a the integral over velocity space where p v be the probability distribution use the boltzmann equation one can prove that h can only decrease for a system of n statistically independent particle h be relate to the thermodynamic entropy s through so accord to the h s can only increase quantum mechanical in quantum statistical mechanic which be the quantum version of classical statistical mechanic the be the function where summation run over all possible distinct state of the system and pi be the probability that the system could be find in the i state this be closely relate to the entropy formula of gibbs and we shall follow waldram proceed use s rather than h first differentiate with respect to time give use the fact that dt since now fermi golden rule give a master equation for the average rate of quantum jump from state α to β and from state β to α of course fermi golden rule itself make certain approximation and the introduction of this rule be what introduce irreversibility it be essentially the quantum version of boltzmann stosszahlansatz for an isolated system the jump will make contribution where the reversibility of the dynamic ensure that the same transition constant ν appear in both expression so but the two difference term in the summation always have the same sign so each contribution to can not be negative therefore for an isolated system the same mathematics be sometimes use to show that relative entropy be a lyapunov function of a markov process in detailed balance and other chemistry contexts classical system in phase space top each system consist of one massive particle in a potential well red curve lower figure the initially compact ensemble becomes swirl up over time josiah willard gibbs describe another way in which the entropy of a microscopic system would tend to increase over time late writer have call this gibbs h a it conclusion resemble that of boltzmann gibbs himself never call it an h and in fact his definition of mechanism of very different from boltzmann this section be include for historical completeness the setting of gibbs entropy production theorem be in ensemble statistical mechanic and the entropy quantity be the gibbs entropy information entropy define in term of the probability distribution for the entire state of the system this be in contrast to boltzmann h define in term of the distribution of state of individual molecule within a specific state of the system gibbs consider the motion of an ensemble which initially start out confine to a small region of phase space meaning that the state of the system be know with fair precision though not quite exactly low gibbs entropy the evolution of this ensemble over time proceeds accord to liouville equation for almost any kind of realistic system the liouville evolution tend to stir the ensemble over phase space a process analogous to the mixing of a dye in an incompressible fluid after some time the ensemble appear to be spread out over phase space although it be actually a finely striped pattern with the total volume of the ensemble and it gibbs entropy conserve liouville equation be guarantee to conserve gibbs entropy since there be no random process act on the system in principle the original ensemble can be recover at any time by reverse the motion the critical point of the theorem be thus if the fine structure in the ensemble be very slightly blur for any reason then the gibbs entropy increase and the ensemble become an equilibrium ensemble a to why this blurring should occur in reality there be a variety of suggested mechanism for example one suggest mechanism be that the phase space be for some reason analogous to the pixelization in the simulation of phase space show in the figure for any required finite degree of fineness the ensemble becomes sensibly uniform after a finite time or if the system experience a tiny uncontrolled interaction with it environment the sharp coherence of the ensemble will be lose edwin thompson jaynes argue that the blurring be subjective in nature simply correspond to a loss of knowledge about the state of the system in any case however it occur the gibbs entropy increase be irreversible provide the blurring can not be reverse the exactly evolve entropy which do not increase be know a entropy the blur entropy be know a entropy leonard susskind analogize this distinction to the notion of the volume of a fibrous ball of cotton on one hand the volume of the fiber themselves be constant but in another sense there be a large volume correspond to the outline of the ball gibbs entropy increase mechanism solve some of the technical difficulty find in boltzmann h the gibbs entropy do not fluctuate nor do it exhibit poincare recurrence and so the increase in gibbs entropy when it occur be therefore irreversible a expect from thermodynamics the gibbs mechanism also apply equally well to system with very few degree of freedom such a the system show in the figure to the extent that one accept that the ensemble becomes blur then gibbs approach be a clean proof of the second law of thermodynamics loschmidt paradox arrow of time second law of thermodynamics fluctuation theorem,H-theorem,Subfields of

topological supersymmetry encompasses such concept a chaos turbulence and crackling noise criticality etc in a topological field theory the correlation function do not depend on the metric of

theory this have prompt ongoing theoretical investigation into this class of model caveat it be often say that tqfts have only finitely many degree of freedom this be not a fundamental property it happen to be true in most of the example that physicist and mathematician study but it be not necessary a topological sigma model target projective space and if such a thing could be define it would have countably infinitely many degree of freedom the known topological field theory fall into two general class tqfts and tqfts witten tqfts be also sometimes refer to a cohomological field theory see in tqfts the correlation function or partition function of the system be compute by the path integral of action functionals for instance in the bf model the spacetime be a manifold m the observables be construct from a f an auxiliary scalar b and their derivative the action which determine the path integral be the spacetime metric do not appear anywhere in the theory so the theory be explicitly topologically invariant the first example appear in and be due to schwarz it action functional be another more famous example be theory which can be apply to knot invariant in general partition function depend on a metric but the above example be the first example of tqfts appear in witten paper in topological theory in four dimension though it action functional contain the spacetime metric g αβ after a topological twist it turn out to be metric independent the independence of the tensor t αβ of the system from the metric depend on whether the be closed follow witten example many other example can be find in string theory tqfts arise if the following condition be satisfy the action of the tqft have a symmetry if denote a symmetry transformation a lie derivative then hold the symmetry transformation be exact there be exist observables which satisfy for all the or similar physical quantity be of the form for an arbitrary tensor a an example give a field with the differential operator which satisfy then the action have a symmetry if since further the following hold under the condition that be independent on and act similarly to a functional derivative the expression be proportional to with another now any average of observables for the corresponding haar measure be independent on the geometric field and be therefore topological the third equality use the fact that and the invariance of the haar measure under symmetry transformation since be only a number it lie derivative vanishes original atiyah suggest a set of axiom for topological quantum field theory inspire by segal propose axiom for conformal field theory subsequently segal idea be summarize in and witten geometric meaning of supersymmetry in atiyah axiom be construct by glue the boundary with a differentiable topological or continuous transformation while segal axiom be for conformal transformation these axiom have be relatively useful for mathematical treatment of qfts although it be clear that they capture the whole structure of qfts the basic idea be that a tqft be a functor from a certain category of cobordisms to the category of vector space there be in fact two different set of axiom which could reasonably be call the atiyah axiom these axiom differ basically in whether or not they apply to a tqft define on a single fix n riemannian lorentzian spacetime m or a tqft define on all n spacetimes at once let λ be a commutative ring with for almost all purpose we will have λ or atiyah originally propose the axiom of a topological quantum field theory tqft in dimension d define over a ground ring λ a follow a finitely generate z σ associate to each orient close smooth manifold σ correspond to the homotopy axiom an element z m z m associate to each orient smooth d manifold with boundary m correspond to an additive axiom these data be subject to the following axiom and be add by atiyah z be functorial with respect to orientation preserve diffeomorphisms of σ and m z be involutory z σ where be σ with opposite orientation and z σ denote the dual module z be multiplicative z φ λ for the empty manifold and z φ for the d empty manifold z the hermitian axiom if so that z m can be view a a linear transformation between hermitian vector space then this be equivalent to z be the adjoint of z m remark if for a closed manifold m we view z m a a numerical invariant then for a manifold with a boundary we should think of z m z m a a relative invariant let f σ σ be an diffeomorphism and identify opposite end of σ i by f this give a manifold σ f and our axiom imply where σ f be the induced automorphism of z σ remark for a manifold m with boundary σ we can always form the double which be a closed manifold the fifth axiom show that where on the right we compute the norm in the hermitian possibly indefinite metric relation to physically be relate to relativistic invariance while be indicative of the quantum nature of the theory σ be mean to indicate the physical space usually d for standard physic and the extra dimension in σ i be imaginary time the space z m be the hilbert space of the quantum theory and a physical theory with a hamiltonian h will have a time evolution operator eith or an imaginary time operator the main feature of topological qfts be that h which imply that there be no real dynamic or propagation along the cylinder σ i however there can be propagation or tunnel amplitude from to through an intervening manifold m with this reflect the topology of m if m σ then the distinguish vector z m in the hilbert space z σ be think of a the vacuum state define by m for a closed manifold m the number z m be the vacuum expectation value in analogy with statistical mechanic it be also call the partition function the reason why a theory with a zero hamiltonian can be sensibly formulate resides in the feynman path integral approach to qft this incorporate relativistic invariance which apply to general d spacetimes and the theory be formally define by a suitable lagrangian a functional of the classical field of the theory a lagrangian which involve only first derivative in time formally lead to a zero hamiltonian but the lagrangian itself may have feature which relate to the topology of m in atiyah publish a paper in which he describe many new example of topological quantum field theory that be consider at that time it contain some new topological invariant along with some new idea casson invariant donaldson invariant gromov theory floer homology and theory d in this case σ consist of finitely many point to a single point we associate a vector space v z point and to n the n tensor product v n v the symmetric group sn act on v n a standard way to get the quantum hilbert space be to start with a classical symplectic manifold or phase space and then quantize it let u extend sn to a compact lie group g and consider integrable orbit for which the symplectic structure come from a line bundle then quantization lead to the irreducible representation v of g this be the physical interpretation of the theorem or the theorem the lagrangian of these theory be the classical action holonomy of the line bundle thus topological qft with d relate naturally to the classical representation theory of lie group and the symmetry group d we should consider periodic boundary condition give by closed loop in a compact symplectic manifold x along with holonomy such loop a use in the case of d a a lagrangian be then use to modify the hamiltonian for a closed surface m the invariant z m of the theory be the number of pseudo holomorphic map f m x in the sense of gromov they be ordinary holomorphic map if x be a kähler manifold if this number become infinite if there be modulus then we must fix further data on m this can be do by pick some point pi and then look at holomorphic map f m x with f pi constrain to lie on a fix hyperplane have write down the relevant lagrangian for this theory floer have give a rigorous treatment floer homology base on morse theory idea for the case when the boundary condition be over the interval instead of be periodic the path initial and lie on two fixed lagrangian submanifolds this theory have be develop a invariant theory another example be holomorphic conformal field theory this might not have be consider strictly topological quantum field theory at the time because hilbert space be infinite dimensional the conformal field theory be also relate to the compact lie group g in which the classical phase consist of a central extension of the loop group lg quantize these produce the hilbert space of the theory of irreducible projective representation of lg the group now substitute for the symmetric group and play an important role a a result the partition function in such theory depend on complex structure thus it be not purely topological d theory be the most important theory in this case here the classical phase space associate with a closed surface σ be the moduli space of a flat g over σ the lagrangian be an integer multiple of the function of a g on a which have to be frame the integer multiple k call the level be a parameter of the theory and k give the classical limit this theory can be naturally couple with the d theory to produce a relative theory the detail have be describe by witten who show that the partition function for a framed link in the be just the value of the jones polynomial for a suitable root of unity the theory can be define over the relevant cyclotomic field see by consider a riemann surface with boundary we can couple it to the d conformal theory instead of couple d theory to d this have develop into theory and have lead to the discovery of deep connection between knot theory and quantum field theory d donaldson have define the integer invariant of smooth by use moduli space of su these invariant be polynomial on the second homology thus should have extra data consist of the symmetric algebra of h have produce a lagrangian which formally reproduce the donaldson theory witten formula might be understand a an analogue of the theorem at a late date this theory be far developed and become the gauge theory which reduce su to u in n d gauge theory the hamiltonian version of the theory have be develop by floer in term of the space of connection on a floer use the function which be the lagrangian of theory to modify the hamiltonian for detail see have also show how one can couple the d and d theory together this be quite analogous to the coupling between d and d in theory now topological field theory be view a a functor not on a fixed dimension but on all dimension at the same time case of a fixed let bordm be the category whose morphisms be n submanifolds of m and whose object be connected component of the boundary of such submanifolds regard two morphisms a equivalent if they be homotopic via submanifolds of m and so form the quotient category hbordm the object in hbordm be the object of bordm and the morphisms of hbordm be homotopy equivalence class of morphisms in bordm a tqft on m be a symmetric monoidal functor from hbordm to the category of vector space note that cobordisms can if their boundary match be sew together to form a new bordism this be the composition law for morphisms in the cobordism category since functors be require to preserve composition this say that the linear map correspond to a sewn together morphism be just the composition of the linear map for each piece there be an equivalence of category between the category of topological quantum field theory and the category of commutative frobenius algebra n spacetimes at pair of pant be a bordism which correspond to a product or coproduct in a tqft to consider all spacetimes at once it be necessary to replace hbordm by a large category so let bordn be the category of bordisms the category whose morphisms be n manifold with boundary and whose object be the connected component of the boundary of manifold note that any n manifold may appear a an object in bordn a above regard two morphisms in bordn a equivalent if they be homotopic and form the quotient category hbordn be a monoidal category under the operation which map two bordisms to the bordism make from their disjoint union a tqft on n manifold be then a functor from hbordn to the category of vector space which map disjoint union of bordisms to their tensor product for example for bordisms bordisms between manifold the map associate with a pair of pant give a product or coproduct depend on how the boundary component be group which be commutative or cocommutative while the map associate with a disk give a counit trace or unit scalar depend on the grouping of boundary component and thus tqfts correspond to frobenius algebra furthermore we can consider simultaneously and manifold relate by the above bordisms and from them we can obtain ample and important example at a later look at the development of topological quantum field theory we should consider it many application to gauge theory topological string theory the relationship between knot theory and quantum field theory and quantum knot invariant furthermore it have generate topic of great interest in both mathematics and physic also of important recent interest be operator in tqft if string theory be view a the fundamental then tqfts can be view a model that provide a computationally efficient approximation to local string theory tqfts and dynamical system stochastic partial differential equation sdes be the foundation for model of everything in nature above the scale of quantum degeneracy and coherence and be essentially tqfts all sdes possess topological or brst supersymmetry and in the

national institute of standard and technology a a standard volt the effect be the phenomenon of supercurrent a current that flow indefinitely long without any voltage apply across a device know a a junction jj which consist of two or more superconductors couple by a weak link the weak link can consist of a thin insulating barrier know a a junction or a short section of metal or a physical constriction that weaken the superconductivity at the point of contact the josephson effect be an example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon it be name after the british physicist brian david josephson who predict in the mathematical relationship for the current and voltage across the weak link the dc josephson effect have be see in experiment prior to but have be attribute to or breach in the insulating barrier lead to the direct conduction of electron between the superconductors the first paper to claim the discovery of josephson effect and to make the requisite experimental check be that of philip anderson and john rowell these author be award patent on the effect that be never enforce but never challenge before josephson prediction it be only know that normal electron can flow through an insulate barrier by mean of quantum tunnel josephson be the first to predict the tunneling of superconducting cooper pair for this work josephson receive the nobel prize in physic in josephson junction have important application in circuit such a squid superconducting qubits and rsfq digital electronics the nist standard for one volt be achieve by an array of josephson junction in series the electrical symbol for a josephson junction type of josephson junction include the φ josephson junction of which π josephson junction be a special example long josephson junction and superconducting tunnel junction a dayem bridge be a variant of the josephson junction in which the weak link consist of a superconducting wire with dimension on the scale of a few micrometres or less the josephson junction count of a device be use a a benchmark for it complexity the josephson effect have find wide usage for example in the following area squid or superconducting quantum interference device be very sensitive magnetometer that operate via the josephson effect they be widely use in science and engineering in precision metrology the josephson effect provide an exactly reproducible conversion between frequency and voltage since the frequency be already define precisely and practically by the caesium standard the josephson effect be use for most practical purpose to give the standard representation of a volt the josephson voltage standard transistor be often construct of superconducting material allow use to be make of the josephson effect to achieve novel effect the resulting device be call a superconducting transistor the josephson effect be also use for the most precise measurement of elementary charge in term of the josephson constant and von klitzing constant which be relate to the quantum hall effect rsfq digital electronics be base on shunted josephson junction in this case the junction switch event be associate to the emission of one magnetic flux quantum that carry the digital information the absence of switch be equivalent to while one switch event carry a josephson junction be integral in superconducting quantum compute a qubits such a in a flux qubit or others scheme where the phase and charge act a the conjugate variable superconducting tunnel junction detector stjs may become a viable replacement for ccds device for use in astronomy and astrophysics in a few year these device be effective across a wide spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared and also in the technology have be try out on the william herschel telescope in the scam instrument quiterons and similar superconducting switching device josephson effect have also be observe in shequids the superfluid helium analog of a diagram of a single josephson junction a and b represent superconductors and c the weak link between them a diagram of a single josephson junction be show at right assume that superconductor a have order parameter and superconductor b which can be interpret a the wave function of cooper pair in the two superconductors if the electric potential difference across the junction be then the energy difference between the two superconductors be since each cooper pair have twice the charge of one electron the schrödinger equation for this quantum system be therefore where the constant be a characteristic of the junction to solve the above equation first calculate the time derivative of the order parameter in superconductor a and therefore the schrödinger equation give denote a the phase difference across the junction we have and it complex conjugate equation be add the two conjugate equation together to eliminate since we have now subtract the two conjugate equation to eliminate which give similarly for superconductor b we can derive that note that the time derivative of charge carrier density be proportional to current and the above solution yield the basic relation govern the dynamic of the josephson effect josephson relation or relation josephson relation or superconducting phase evolution equation where and be the voltage across and the current through the josephson junction and be a parameter of the junction name the critical current the critical current be an important phenomenological parameter of the device that can be affect by temperature as well a by an applied magnetic field the physical constant be the magnetic flux quantum the inverse of which be the josephson constant typical characteristic of a superconducting tunnel junction a common kind of josephson junction the scale of the vertical axis be μa and that of the horizontal one be mv the bar at represent the dc josephson effect while the current at large value of be due to the finite value of the superconductor bandgap and not reproduce by the above equation the three main effect predict by josephson follow from these relation dc josephson the dc josephson effect be a direct current cross the insulator in the absence of any external electromagnetic field owe to tunnel this dc josephson current be proportional to the sine of the phase difference across the insulator and may take value between and ac josephson with a fixed voltage across the junction the phase will vary linearly with time and the current will be an ac current with amplitude and frequency this mean a josephson junction can act a a perfect converter inverse ac josephson microwave radiation of a single angular frequency can induce quantized dc voltage across the josephson junction in which case the josephson phase take the form and the voltage and current across the junction will be the dc component be this mean a josephson junction can act like a perfect converter which be the theoretical basis for josephson voltage standard the resistively shunted junction rsj model also know a resistively and capacitively shunted junction rcsj model or simply shunted junction model include the effect of ac impedance of an actual josephson junction on top of the two basic josephson relation state above a per thévenin theorem the ac impedance of the junction can be represent by a capacitor and a shunt resistor both parallel to the ideal josephson junction the complete expression for the current drive becomes where be the effective capacitance and the effective resistance of the junction the josephson phase be the difference of the phase of the quantum mechanical wave function in two superconducting electrode form a josephson junction if the macroscopic wave function and in superconductors and be give by then the josephson phase be define by when the current and josephson phase varies over time the voltage drop across the junction will also vary accordingly a show in derivation below the josephson relation determine that this behavior can be model by a kinetic inductance name josephson inductance rewrite the josephson relation a now apply the chain rule to calculate the time derivative of the current rearrange the above result in the form of the characteristic of an inductor this give the expression for the kinetic inductance a a function of the josephson phase here be a characteristic parameter of the josephson junction name the josephson inductance note that although the kinetic behavior of the josephson junction be similar to that of an inductor there be no associated magnetic field this behaviour be derive from the kinetic energy of the charge carrier instead of the energy in a magnetic field base on the similarity of the josephson junction to a inductor the energy store in a josephson junction when a supercurrent flow through it can be calculate again note that a inductance accumulate potential energy in it magnetic field when a current pass through it however in the case of josephson junction no magnetic field be create by a supercurrent the store energy come from the kinetic energy of the charge carrier instead the supercurrent flow through the junction be relate to the josephson phase by the relation cpr imagine that initially at time the junction be in the ground state and finally at time the junction have the phase the work do on the junction equal the energy increase in the junction here set the characteristic scale of the josephson energy and set it dependence on the phase the energy accumulate inside the junction depend only on the current state of the junction but not on history or

in mathematics the group name after werner heisenberg be the group of upper triangular matrix of the form under the operation of matrix multiplication elements a b and c can be take from any commutative ring with identity often take to be the ring of real number result in the continuous heisenberg group or the ring of integer result in the discrete heisenberg group the continuous heisenberg group arise in the description of quantum mechanical system especially in the context of the neumann theorem more generally one can consider heisenberg group associate to n system and most generally to any symplectic vector space in the case the product of two heisenberg matrix be give by a one can see the group be the neutral element of the heisenberg group be the identity matrix and inverse be give by the group be a subgroup of the affine group aff act on corresponds to the affine transform there be several prominent example of the case heisenberg if be real number in the ring then one have the heisenberg group it be a nilpotent real lie group of dimension in addition to the representation a real matrix the continuous heisenberg group also have several different representation in term of function space by neumann theorem there be up to isomorphism a unique irreducible unitary representation of h in which it centre act by a give nontrivial character this representation have several important realization or model in the schrödinger model the heisenberg group act on the space of square integrable function in the theta representation it act on the space of holomorphic function on the upper it be so name for it connection with the theta function heisenberg a portion of the cayley graph of the discrete heisenberg group with generator x y z a in the text the coloring be only for visual aid if be integer in the ring then one have the heisenberg group it be a nilpotent group it have two generator and relation where be the generator of the center of note that the inverse of x y and z replace the above the diagonal with by bass theorem it have a polynomial growth rate of order one can generate any element through heisenberg group modulo an odd prime p if one take a b c in p for an odd prime p then one have the group modulo p it be a group of order p with generator x y and relation analogue of heisenberg group over finite field of odd prime order p be call extra special group or more properly extra special group of exponent p more generally if the derive subgroup of a group g be contain in the center z of g then the map from z be a bilinear operator on abelian group however require that to be a finite vector space require the frattini subgroup of g to be contain in the center and require that z be a vector space over p require that z have order p so if g be not abelian then g be extra special if g be extra special but do not have exponent p then the general construction below apply to the symplectic vector space do not yield a group isomorphic to g group modulo the heisenberg group modulo be of order and be isomorphic to the dihedral group the symmetry of a square observe that if then and the element x and y correspond to reflection with between them whereas xy and yx correspond to rotation by the other reflection be xyx and yxy and rotation by be xyxy yxyx the lie algebra of the heisenberg group over the real number be the space of matrix of the form with the following three element form a basis for the basis elements satisfy the commutation relation the name heisenberg group be motivate by the preceding relation which have the same form a the canonical commutation relation in quantum mechanic where be the position operator be the momentum operator and be planck constant the heisenberg group have the special property that the exponential map be a and onto map from the lie algebra to the group more general heisenberg group may be define for high dimension in euclidean space and more generally on symplectic vector space the simple general case be the real heisenberg group of dimension for any integer a a group of matrix or to indicate this be the heisenberg group over the field of real number be define a the group matrices with entry in and have the form where be a row vector of length n be a column vector of length n i be the identity matrix of size n this be indeed a group a be show by the multiplication and the heisenberg group be a lie group whose lie algebra consist of matrix where be a row vector of length n be a column vector of length n n be the zero matrix of size n by let e n be the canonical basis of n and set the associate lie algebra can be characterize by the canonical commutation relation where p q z be the algebra generator in particular z be a central element of the heisenberg lie algebra note that the lie algebra of the heisenberg group be nilpotent let which fulfill the exponential map evaluate to the exponential map of any nilpotent lie algebra be a diffeomorphism between the lie algebra and the unique associate connected lie group this discussion aside from statement refer to dimension and lie group further applies if we replace by any commutative ring a the corresponding group be denote h a under the additional assumption that the prime be invertible in the ring a the exponential map be also define since it reduce to a finite sum and have the form above could be a ring p with an odd prime p or any field of characteristic the unitary representation theory of the heisenberg group be fairly simple later generalize by mackey theory and be the motivation for it introduction in quantum physic a discuss below for each nonzero real number we can define an irreducible unitary representation of act on the hilbert space by the formula this representation be know a the schrödinger representation the motivation for this representation be the action of the exponentiated position and momentum operator in quantum mechanic the parameter describes translation in position space the parameter describes translation in momentum space and the parameter give an overall phase factor the phase factor be need to obtain a group of operator since translation in position space and translation in momentum space do not commute the key result be the neumann theorem which state that every strongly continuous irreducible unitary representation of the heisenberg group in which the center act nontrivially be equivalent to for some alternatively that they be all equivalent to the weyl algebra or ccr algebra on a symplectic space of dimension n since the heisenberg group be a central extension of it irreducible unitary representation can be view a irreducible unitary projective representation of conceptually the representation give above constitute the quantum mechanical counterpart to the group of translational symmetry on the classical phase space the fact that the quantum version be only a projective representation of be suggest already at the classical level the hamiltonian generator of translation in phase space be the position and momentum function the span of these function do not form a lie algebra under the poisson bracket however because rather the span of the position and momentum function and the constant form a lie algebra under the poisson bracket this lie algebra be a central extension of the commutative lie algebra isomorphic to the lie algebra of the heisenberg group the general abstraction of a heisenberg group be construct from any symplectic vector space for example let v ω be a real symplectic vector space so ω be a nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form on v the heisenberg group h v on v ω or simply v for brevity be the set v endow with the group law the heisenberg group be a central extension of the additive group v thus there be an exact sequence any symplectic vector space admit a darboux basis j f k j n satisfy ω j f k δ j and where n be the dimension of v the dimension of v be necessarily even in term of this basis every vector decompose a the q and p be canonically conjugate coordinate if j k j n be a darboux basis for v then let e be a basis for and j k e j n be the corresponding basis for v a vector in h v be then give by and the group law become because the underlying manifold of the heisenberg group be a linear space vector in the lie algebra can be canonically identify with vector in the group the lie algebra of the heisenberg group be give by the commutation relation or write in term of the darboux basis and all other commutator vanish it be also possible to define the group law in a different way but which yield a group isomorphic to the group we have just define to avoid confusion we will use u instead of t so a vector be give by and the group law be an element of the group can then be express a a matrix which give a faithful matrix representation of h v the u in this formulation be relate to t in our previous formulation by so that the t value for the product come to a before the isomorphism to the group use upper triangular matrix relies on the decomposition of v into a darboux basis which amount to a choice of isomorphism v u u although the new group law yield a group isomorphic to the one give high up the group with this law be sometimes refer to a the heisenberg group a a reminder that this group law rely on a choice of basis a choice of a lagrangian subspace of v be a polarization to any lie algebra there be a unique connect simply connected lie group g all other connect lie group with the same lie algebra a g be of the form g n where n be a central discrete group in g in this case the center of h v be and the only discrete subgroup be isomorphic to z thus h v be another lie group which share this lie algebra of note about this lie group be that it admit no faithful representation it be not isomorphic to any matrix group it do however have a family of unitary representation the lie algebra of the heisenberg group be describe above a a lie algebra of matrix the theorem applies to determine the universal envelop algebra among other property the universal envelop algebra be an associative algebra into which injectively imbeds by the theorem it be thus the free vector space generate by the monomials where the exponent be all consequently consist of real polynomial with the commutation relation the algebra be closely relate to the algebra of differential operator on ℝ n with polynomial coefficient since any such operator have a unique representation in the form this algebra be call the weyl algebra it follow from abstract nonsense that the weyl algebra wn be a quotient of however this be also easy to see directly from the above representation viz by the mapping weyl parameterization of quantum mechanic the application that lead hermann weyl to an explicit realization of the heisenberg group be the question of why the schrödinger picture and heisenberg picture be physically equivalent abstractly the reason be the neumann theorem there be a unique unitary representation with give action of the central lie algebra element z up to a unitary equivalence the nontrivial element of the algebra be all equivalent to the usual position and momentum operator thus the schrödinger picture and heisenberg picture be equivalent they be just different way of realize this essentially unique representation theta representation the same uniqueness result be use by david mumford for discrete heisenberg group in his theory of equation define abelian variety this be a large generalization of the approach use in jacobi elliptic function which be the case of the modulo heisenberg group of order the simple case be the theta representation of the heisenberg group of which the discrete case give the theta function fourier analysis the heisenberg group also occur in fourier analysis where it be use in some formulation of the neumann theorem in this case the heisenberg group can be understand to act on the space of square integrable function the result be a representation of the heisenberg group sometimes call the weyl representation the heisenberg group h on the real can also be understand to be a smooth manifold and specifically a simple example of a manifold give a point p x in define a differential θ at this point a this belong to the cotangent bundle of that be be a map on the tangent bundle let it can be see that h be a subbundle of the tangent bundle t a cometric on h be give by project vector to the space span by vector in the x and y direction that be give vector and in t the inner product be give by the resulting structure turn h into the manifold of the heisenberg group an orthonormal frame on the manifold be give by the lie vector field which obey the relation x z and x y be lie vector field these form a basis for the group action the geodesic on the manifold be spiral project down to circle in two dimension that be if be a geodesic curve then the curve be an arc of a circle and with the integral limited to the plane that be the height of the curve be proportional to the area of the circle subtend by the circular arc which follow by stokes theorem it be more generally possible to define the heisenberg group of a locally compact abelian group k equip with a haar measure such a group have a pontrjagin dual consisting of all continuous character on k which be also a locally compact abelian group if endow with the topology the heisenberg group associate with the locally compact abelian group k be the subgroup of the unitary group of generate by translation from k and multiplication by element of in more detail the hilbert space consist of function on k the translation in k form a unitary representation of k a operator on for so too do the multiplication by character for these operator do not commute and instead satisfy multiplication by a fixed unit modulus complex number so the heisenberg group associate with k be a type of central extension of via an exact sequence of group more general heisenberg group be describe by in the cohomology group the existence of a duality between and give rise to a canonical cocycle but there be generally others the heisenberg group act irreducibly on indeed the continuous character separate point so any unitary operator of that commute with them be an multiplier but commute with translation implies that the multiplier be constant a version of the neumann theorem prove by george mackey hold for the heisenberg group the fourier transform be the

in theoretical physic and mathematical physic mechanic or mechanic be a collection of closely related alternative formulation of classical mechanic it be develop by many scientist and mathematician during the century and onward after newtonian mechanic since newtonian mechanic considers vector quantity of motion particularly acceleration momenta force of the constituent of the system an alternative name for the mechanic govern by newton law and euler law be vectorial mechanic by contrast analytical mechanic use scalar property of motion represent the system a a it total kinetic energy and potential newton vectorial force of individual particle a scalar be a quantity whereas a vector be represent by quantity and direction the equation of motion be derive from the scalar quantity by some underlying principle about the scalar variation analytical mechanic take advantage of a system constraints to solve problem the constraint limit the degree of freedom the system can have and can be use to reduce the number of coordinate need to solve for the motion the formalism be well suit to arbitrary choice of coordinate know in the context a generalized coordinate the kinetic and potential energy of the system be express use these generalize coordinate or momentum and the equation of motion can be readily set up thus analytical mechanic allow numerous mechanical problem to be solve with great efficiency than fully vectorial method it do not always work for force or dissipative force like friction in which case one may revert to newtonian mechanic two dominant branch of analytical mechanic be lagrangian mechanic use generalize coordinate and correspond generalized velocity in configuration space and hamiltonian mechanic use coordinate and correspond momentum in phase space both formulation be equivalent by a legendre transformation on the generalize coordinate velocity and momentum therefore both contain the same information for describe the dynamic of a system there be other formulation such a theory routhian mechanic and appell equation of motion all equation of motion for particle and field in any formalism can be derive from the widely applicable result call the principle of least action one result be noether theorem a statement which connect conservation law to their associated symmetry analytical mechanic do not introduce new physic and be not more general than newtonian mechanic rather it be a collection of equivalent formalism which have broad application in fact the same principle and formalism can be use in relativistic mechanic and general relativity and with some modification quantum mechanic and quantum field theory analytical mechanic be use widely from fundamental physic to applied mathematics particularly chaos theory the method of analytical mechanic apply to discrete particle each with a finite number of degree of freedom they can be modify to describe continuous field or fluid which have infinite degree of freedom the definition and equation have a close analogy with those of mechanic generalize coordinate and constraint in newtonian mechanic one customarily use all three cartesian coordinate or other coordinate system to refer to a body position during it motion in physical system however some structure or other system usually constrain the body motion from take certain direction and pathway so a full set of cartesian coordinate be often unneeded a the constraint determine the evolving relation among the coordinate which relation can be model by equation correspond to the constraint in the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism the constraint be incorporate into the motion geometry reduce the number of coordinate to the minimum need to model the motion these be know a generalized coordinate denote qi i difference between curvillinear and generalize coordinate generalize coordinate incorporate constraint on the system there be one generalized coordinate qi for each degree of freedom for convenience label by an index i each way the system can change it configuration a curvilinear length or angle of rotation generalize coordinate be not the same a curvilinear coordinate the number of curvilinear coordinate equal the dimension of the position space in question usually for space while the number of generalized coordinate be not necessarily equal to this dimension constraint can reduce the number of degree of freedom hence the number of generalized coordinate require to define the configuration of the system follow the general rule of position space usually number of of system particle number of number of of freedom number of coordinate for a system with n degree of freedom the generalized coordinate can be collect into an n and the time derivative here denote by an overdot of this tuple give the generalized velocity principle the foundation which the subject be build on be principle this principle state that infinitesimal virtual work do by a force across reversible displacement be zero which be the work do by a force consistent with ideal constraint of the system the idea of a constraint be useful since this limit what the system can do and can provide step to solve for the motion of the system the equation for principle be where be the generalized force script q instead of ordinary q be use here to prevent conflict with canonical transformation below and be the generalized coordinate this lead to the generalized form of newton law in the language of analytical mechanic where t be the total kinetic energy of the system and the notation be a useful shorthand see matrix calculus for this notation holonomic constraint if the curvilinear coordinate system be define by the standard position vector and if the position vector can be write in term of the generalized coordinate and time t in the form and this relation hold for all time t then be call holonomic constraint vector be explicitly dependent on t in case when the constraint vary with time not just because of t for situation the constraint be also call for case they be call lagrangian and equations the introduction of generalized coordinate and the fundamental lagrangian function where t be the total kinetic energy and v be the total potential energy of the entire system then either follow the calculus of variation or use the above formula lead to the equation which be a set of n ordinary differential equation one for each qi t this formulation identify the actual path follow by the motion a a selection of the path over which the time integral of kinetic energy be least assume the total energy to be fix and impose no condition on the time of transit configuration space the lagrangian formulation use the configuration space of the system the set of all possible generalize coordinate where be n real space see also notation the particular solution to the equation be call a configuration path or trajectory one particular t subject to the required initial condition the general solution form a set of possible configuration a function of time the configuration space can be define more generally and indeed more deeply in term of topological manifold and the tangent bundle hamiltonian and hamilton equation the legendre transformation of the lagrangian replace the generalized coordinate and velocity with the generalize coordinate and the generalized momentum conjugate to the generalize coordinate and introduce the hamiltonian which be in term of generalize coordinate and momentum where denote the dot product also lead to hamilton equation which be now a set of n ordinary differential equation one for each qi t and pi t another result from the legendre transformation relate the time derivative of the lagrangian and hamiltonian which be often consider one of hamilton equation of motion additionally to the others the generalized momentum can be write in term of the generalized force in the same way a newton second law generalize momentum space analogous to the configuration space the set of all momentum be the momentum space technically in this context generalize momentum space momentum space also refer to k the set of all wave vector give by de broglie relation a use in quantum mechanic and theory of wave this be not refer to in this context phase space the set of all position and momentum form the phase space that be the cartesian product of the configuration space and generalize momentum space a particular solution to hamilton equation be call a phase path a particular curve t p t subject to the required initial condition the set of all phase paths the general solution to the differential equation be the phase portrait the poisson bracket all dynamical variable can be derive from position momentum and time t and write a a function of these a a t if a t and b t be two scalar value dynamical variable the poisson bracket be define by the generalized coordinate and momentum calculate the total derivative of one of these say a and substitute hamilton equation into the result lead to the time evolution of a this equation in a be closely relate to the equation of motion in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanic in which classical dynamical variable become quantum operator indicate by hat and the poisson bracket be replace by the commutator of operator via dirac canonical quantization follow be overlap property between the lagrangian and hamiltonian function all the individual generalized coordinate qi t velocity t and momentum pi t for every degree of freedom be mutually independent explicit of a function mean the function actually include time t a a variable in addition to the t t not simply a a parameter through t and t which would mean explicit the lagrangian be invariant under addition of the total time derivative of any function of and t that be so each lagrangian l and l describe exactly the same motion in other word the lagrangian of a system be not unique analogously the hamiltonian be invariant under addition of the partial time derivative of any function of and t that be k be a frequently use letter in this case this property be use in canonical transformation see below the lagrangian be independent of some generalize coordinate then the generalize momentum conjugate to those coordinate be constant of the motion be conserve this immediately follow from lagrange equation such coordinate be cyclic or ignorable it can be show that the hamiltonian be also cyclic in exactly the same generalize coordinate the lagrangian be the hamiltonian be also both be constant in time the kinetic energy be a homogeneous function of degree of the generalized velocity and the lagrangian be explicitly then where λ be a constant then the hamiltonian will be the total conserved energy equal to the total kinetic and potential energy of the system this be the basis for the schrödinger equation insert quantum operator directly obtain it configuration space only some be show the path take by the system red have a stationary action δ s under small change in the configuration of the system δ action be another quantity in analytical mechanic define a a functional of the lagrangian a general way to find the equation of motion from the action be the principle of least action where the departure t and arrival t time be fix the term path or trajectory refers to the time evolution of the system a a path through configuration space in other word t trace out a path in the path for which action be least be the path take by the system from this principle all equation of motion in classical mechanic can be derive this approach can be extend to field rather than a system of particle see below and underlie the path integral formulation of quantum mechanic and be use for calculate geodesic motion in general relativity canonical transformation the invariance of the hamiltonian under addition of the partial time derivative of an arbitrary function of and t allow the hamiltonian in one set of coordinate and momentum to be transform into a new set t and t in four possible way with the restriction on and such that the transform hamiltonian system be the above transformation be call canonical transformation each function gn be call a generate function of the th kind or n the transformation of coordinate and momentum can allow simplification for solve hamilton equation for a give problem the choice of and be completely arbitrary but not every choice lead to a canonical transformation one simple criterion for a transformation and to be canonical be the poisson bracket be unity for all i if this do not hold then the transformation be not canonical the equation by set the canonically transformed hamiltonian k and the generate function equal to principal function also the action plus an arbitrary constant c the generalize momentum become and be constant then the equation hje can be derive from the canonical transformation where h be the hamiltonian a before another related function be characteristic function use to solve the hje by additive separation of variable for a hamiltonian h the study of the solution of the equation lead naturally to the study of symplectic manifold and symplectic topology in this formulation the solution of the equation be the integral curve of hamiltonian vector field routhian mechanic be a hybrid formulation of lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanic not often use but especially useful for remove cyclic coordinate if the lagrangian of a system have s cyclic coordinate q q q with conjugate momentum p p p with the rest of the coordinate and denote ζ ζ ζn s they can be remove by introduce the routhian which lead to a set of s hamiltonian equation for the cyclic coordinate and n s lagrangian equation in the non cyclic coordinate set up in this way although the routhian have the form of the hamiltonian it can be think of a lagrangian with n s degree of freedom the coordinate do not have to be cyclic the partition between which coordinate enter the hamiltonian equation and those which enter the lagrangian equation be arbitrary it be simply convenient to let the hamiltonian equation remove the cyclic coordinate leave the non cyclic coordinate to the lagrangian equation of motion appell equation of motion involve generalize acceleration the second time derivative of the generalized coordinate as well a generalized force mention above in principle the equation be where be the acceleration of the k particle the second time derivative of it position vector each acceleration k be express in term of the generalized acceleration αr likewise each be express in term the generalize coordinate qr lagrangian field theory generalize coordinate apply to discrete particle for n scalar field φi t where i n the density be a function of these field and their space and time derivative and possibly the space and time coordinate themselves and the equation have an analogue for field where denote the and the summation convention have be use for n scalar field these lagrangian field equation be a set of n second order partial differential equation in the field which in general will be couple and nonlinear this scalar field formulation can be extend to vector field tensor field and spinor field the lagrangian be the volume integral of the lagrangian density originally develop for classical field the above formulation be applicable to all physical field in classical quantum and relativistic situation such a newtonian gravity classical electromagnetism general relativity and quantum field theory it be a question of determine the correct lagrangian density to generate the correct field equation hamiltonian field theory the corresponding momentum field density conjugate to the n scalar field φi t be where in this context the overdot denote a partial time derivative not a total time derivative the density be define by analogy with mechanic the equation of motion be where the variational derivative must be use instead of merely partial derivative for n field these hamiltonian field equation be a set of n first order partial differential equation which in general will be couple and nonlinear again the volume integral of the hamiltonian density be the hamiltonian symmetry transformation in classical space and time each transformation can be describe by an operator function act on the position or momentum variable to change them the follow be the case when the operator do not change or symmetry transformation operator position momentum translational symmetry time translation rotational invariance galilean transformation parity where r θ be the rotation matrix about an axis define by the unit vector and angle noether theorem noether theorem state that a continuous symmetry transformation of the action correspond to a conservation law the action and hence the lagrangian do change under a transformation parameterized by a parameter s the lagrangian describe the same motion independent of s which can be length angle of rotation or time the corresponding momentum to q will be conserve

in relativistic physic symmetry name after hendrik lorentz be an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to special relativity implying that the law of physic stay the same for all observer that be move with respect to one another within an inertial frame it have also be describe a the feature of nature that say experimental result be independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space lorentz covariance a related concept be a property of the underlying spacetime manifold lorentz covariance have two distinct but closely related meaning a physical quantity be say to be lorentz covariant if it transform under a give representation of the lorentz group accord to the representation theory of the lorentz group these quantity be build out of scalar and spinors in particular a lorentz covariant scalar the interval remain the same under lorentz transformation and be say to be a lorentz invariant they transform under the trivial representation an equation be say to be lorentz covariant if it can be write in term of lorentz covariant quantity confusingly some use the term invariant here the key property of such equation be that if they hold in one inertial frame then they hold in any inertial frame this follow from the result that if all the component of a tensor vanish in one frame they vanish in every frame this condition be a requirement accord to the principle of relativity all law must make the same prediction for identical experiment take place at the same spacetime event in two different inertial frame of reference on manifold the word covariant and contravariant refer to how object transform under general coordinate transformation both covariant and contravariant can be lorentz covariant quantity local lorentz covariance which follow from general relativity refers to lorentz covariance apply only locally in an infinitesimal region of spacetime at every point there be a generalization of this concept to cover poincaré covariance and poincaré invariance in general the transformational nature of a lorentz tensor can be identify by it tensor order which be the number of free index it have no index imply it be a scalar one imply that it be a vector etc some tensor with a physical interpretation be list below the sign convention of the minkowski metric η diag be use throughout the article spacetime interval proper time for timelike interval proper distance for spacelike interval mass electromagnetism invariant operator which be the partial derivative where where and be the rest mass where kronecker delta minkowski metric the metric of flat space accord to general relativity electromagnetic field tensor use a metric signature of dual electromagnetic field tensor in standard field theory there be very strict and severe constraint on marginal and relevant lorentz violating operator within both qed and the standard model irrelevant lorentz violate operator may be suppress by a high cutoff scale but they typically induce marginal and relevant lorentz violate operator via radiative correction so we also have very strict and severe constraint on irrelevant lorentz violating operator since some approach to quantum gravity lead to violation of lorentz invariance these study be part of phenomenological quantum gravity lorentz violation be allow in string theory supersymmetry and gravity lorentz violate model typically fall into four class the law of physic be exactly lorentz covariant but this symmetry be spontaneously break in special relativistic theory this lead to phonons which be the goldstone bosons the phonons travel at less than the speed of light similar to the approximate lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice where the speed of sound play the role of the critical speed the lorentz symmetry of special relativity with the speed of light a the critical speed in vacuum be only a limit of the law of physic which involve new phenomenon at some fundamental scale bare conventional elementary particle be not object at very small distance scale and a nonzero fundamental length must be take into account lorentz symmetry violation be govern by an parameter which tend to zero a momentum decrease such pattern require the existence of a privileged local inertial frame the vacuum rest frame they can be test at least partially by energy cosmic ray experiment like the pierre auger observatory the law of physic be symmetric under a deformation of the lorentz or more generally the poincaré group and this deformed symmetry be exact and unbroken this deformed symmetry be also typically a quantum group symmetry which be a generalization of a group symmetry deform special relativity be an example of this class of model the deformation be scale dependent meaning that at length scale much large than the planck scale the symmetry look pretty much like the poincaré group energy cosmic ray experiment can not test such model very special relativity form a class of it own if cp be an exact symmetry a subgroup of the lorentz group be sufficient to give u all the standard prediction this be however not the case model belong to the first two class can be consistent with experiment if lorentz breaking happens at planck scale or beyond it or even before it in suitable preonic model and if lorentz symmetry violation be govern by a suitable parameter one then have a class of model which deviate from poincaré symmetry near the planck scale but still flow towards an exact poincaré group at very large length scale this be also true for the third class which be furthermore protect from radiative correction a one still have an exact quantum symmetry even though there be no evidence of the violation of lorentz invariance several experimental search for such violation have be perform during recent year a detailed summary of the result of these search be give in the data table for lorentz and cpt violation lorentz invariance be also violate in qft assume temperature there be also grow evidence of lorentz violation in weyl semimetals and dirac semimetals antimatter test of lorentz violation symmetry general covariance lorentz

development in the branch of mathematics call differential geometry an connection be a geometric object on a smooth manifold which connect nearby tangent space so it permit tangent vector field to be differentiate a if they be function on the manifold with value in a fixed vector space the notion of an affine connection have it root in geometry and tensor calculus but be not fully develop until the early by élie cartan a part of his general theory of connection and hermann weyl who use the notion a a part of his foundation for general relativity the terminology be due to cartan and have it origin in the identification of tangent space in euclidean space by translation the idea be that a choice of affine connection make a manifold look infinitesimally like euclidean space not just smoothly but a an affine space on any manifold of positive dimension there be infinitely many affine connection if the manifold be further endow with a riemannian metric then there be a natural choice of affine connection call the connection the choice of an affine connection be equivalent to prescribe a way of differentiate vector field which satisfy several reasonable property linearity and the leibniz rule this yield a possible definition of an affine connection a a covariant derivative or linear connection on the tangent bundle a choice of affine connection be also equivalent to a notion of parallel transport which be a method for transport tangent vector along curve this also define a parallel transport on the frame bundle infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yield another description of an affine connection either a a cartan connection for the affine group or a a principal connection on the frame bundle the main invariant of an affine connection be it torsion and it curvature the torsion measure how closely the lie bracket of vector field can be recover from the affine connection affine connection may also be use to define affine geodesic on a manifold generalize the straight line of euclidean space although the geometry of those straight line can be very different from usual euclidean geometry the main difference be encapsulate in the curvature of the connection a smooth manifold be a mathematical object which look locally like a smooth deformation of euclidean space for example a smooth curve or surface look locally like a smooth deformation of a line or a plane smooth function and vector field can be define on manifold just a they can on euclidean space and scalar function on manifold can be differentiate in a natural way however differentiation of vector field be less straightforward this be a simple matter in euclidean space because the tangent space of base vector at a point can be identify naturally by translation with the tangent space at a nearby point on a general manifold there be no such natural identification between nearby tangent space and so tangent vector at nearby point can not be compare in a way the notion of an affine connection be introduce to remedy this problem by connect nearby tangent space the origin of this idea can be trace back to two main source surface theory and tensor calculus from surface consider a smooth surface in euclidean space near to any point can be approximate by it tangent plane at that point which be an affine subspace of euclidean space differential geometer in the century be interested in the notion of development in which one surface be roll along another without slip or twist in particular the tangent plane to a point of can be roll on this should be easy to imagine when be a surface like the which be the smooth boundary of a convex region a the tangent plane be roll on the point of contact trace out a curve on conversely give a curve on the tangent plane can be roll along that curve this provide a way to identify the tangent plane at different point along the curve in particular a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve be identify with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve these identification be always give by affine transformation from one tangent plane to another this notion of parallel transport of tangent vector by affine transformation along a curve have a characteristic feature the point of contact of the tangent plane with the surface always move with the curve under parallel translation a the tangent plane be roll along the surface the point of contact move this generic condition be characteristic of cartan connection in more modern approach the point of contact be view a the origin in the tangent plane which be then a vector space and the movement of the origin be correct by a translation so that parallel transport be linear rather than affine in the point of view of cartan connection however the affine subspace of euclidean space be model surface they be the simple surface in euclidean and be homogeneous under the affine group of the plane and every smooth surface have a unique model surface tangent to it at each point these model surface be klein geometry in the sense of felix klein erlangen programme more generally an affine space be a klein geometry for the affine group the stabilizer of a point be the general linear group an affine be then a manifold which look infinitesimally like affine space from tensor historically people use covariant derivative or connection give by metric to describe the variation rate of a vector along the direction of another vector here on the punctured euclidean space the blue vector field send the to everywhere the red vector field send the to everywhere endorse by the metric the connection be everywhere indicate have no change along in other word parallel transport along each concentric circle everywhere which send to everywhere implying have a constant changing rate on the radial direction the second motivation for affine connection come from the notion of a covariant derivative of vector field before the advent of method it be necessary to work with vector field by embed their respective euclidean vector into an atlas these component can be differentiate but the derivative do not transform in a manageable way under change of coordinate correction term be introduce by elwin bruno christoffel follow idea of bernhard riemann in the so that the corrected derivative of one vector field along another transform covariantly under coordinate transformation these correction term subsequently come to be know a christoffel symbols this idea be develop into the theory of absolute differential calculus now know a tensor calculus by gregorio and his student tullio between and the turn of the century tensor calculus really come to life however with the advent of albert einstein theory of general relativity in a few year after this formalize the unique connection associate to a riemannian metric now know a the connection more general affine connection be then study around by hermann weyl who develop a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity and élie cartan who make the link with the geometrical idea come from surface theory the complex history have lead to the development of widely vary approach to and generalization of the affine connection concept the most popular approach be probably the definition motivate by covariant derivative on the one hand the idea of weyl be take up by physicist in the form of gauge theory and gauge covariant derivative on the other hand the notion of covariant differentiation be abstract by koszul who define linear or koszul connection on vector bundle in this language an affine connection be simply a covariant derivative or linear connection on the tangent bundle however this approach do not explain the geometry behind affine connection nor how they acquire their name the term really have it origin in the identification of tangent space in euclidean space by translation this property mean that euclidean be an affine space alternatively euclidean space be a principal homogeneous space or torsor under the group of translation which be a subgroup of the affine group a mention in the introduction there be several way to make this precise one use the fact that an affine connection define a notion of parallel transport of vector field along a curve this also define a parallel transport on the frame bundle infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yield another description of an affine connection either a a cartan connection for the affine group or a a principal connection on the frame bundle let be a smooth manifold and let be the space of vector field on that be the space of smooth section of the tangent bundle then an connection on be a bilinear map such that for all smooth function in and all vector field on that be be linear in the first variable that be satisfies leibniz rule in the second variable it follow from property above that the value of at a point depend only on the value of at and not on the value of on it also follow from property above that the value of at a point depend only on the value of on a neighbourhood of if be affine connection then the value at of may be write where be bilinear and depend smoothly on it define a smooth bundle homomorphism conversely if be an affine connection and be such a smooth bilinear bundle homomorphism call a connection form on then be an affine connection if be an open subset of then the tangent bundle of be the trivial bundle in this situation there be a canonical affine connection on any vector field be give by a smooth function from to then be the vector field correspond to the smooth function from to any other affine connection on may therefore be write where be a connection form on more generally a local trivialization of the tangent bundle be a bundle isomorphism between the restriction of to an open subset of and the restriction of an affine connection to may then be write in the form where be a connection form on parallel transport of a tangent vector along a curve in the sphere comparison of tangent vector at different point on a manifold be generally not a process an affine connection provide one way to remedy this use the notion of parallel transport and indeed this can be use to give a definition of an affine connection let be a manifold with an affine connection then a vector field be say to be if in the sense that for any vector field intuitively speak parallel vector have all their derivative equal to zero and be therefore in some sense constant by evaluate a parallel vector field at two point and an identification between a tangent vector at and one at be obtain such tangent vector be say to be transport of each other nonzero parallel vector field do not in general exist because the equation be a partial differential equation which be overdetermined the integrability condition for this equation be the vanishing of the of see below however if this equation be restrict to a curve from to it become an ordinary differential equation there be then a unique solution for any initial value of at more precisely if a smooth curve parametrized by an interval and where then a vector field along and in particular the value of this vector field at be call the transport of along if for all formally the first condition mean that be parallel with respect to the pullback connection on the pullback bundle however in a local trivialization it be a system of linear ordinary differential equation which have a unique solution for any initial condition give by the second condition for instance by the theorem thus parallel transport provide a way of move tangent vector along a curve use the affine connection to keep them point in the same direction in an intuitive sense and this provide a linear isomorphism between the tangent space at the two end of the curve the isomorphism obtain in this way will in general depend on the choice of the curve if it do not then parallel transport along every curve can be use to define parallel vector field on which can only happen if the curvature of be zero a linear isomorphism be determine by it action on an ordered basis or hence parallel transport can also be characterize a a way of transport element of the tangent frame bundle along a curve in other word the affine connection provide a of any curve in to a curve in an affine connection may also be define a a principal connection on the frame bundle or of a manifold in more detail be a smooth map from the tangent bundle of the frame bundle to the space of matrix which be the lie algebra of the lie group of invertible matrix satisfy two property be equivariant with respect to the action of on and for any in where be the vector field on correspond to such a connection immediately define a covariant derivative not only on the tangent bundle but on vector bundle associate to any group representation of include bundle of tensor and tensor density conversely an affine connection on the tangent bundle determine an affine connection on the frame bundle for instance by require that vanishes on tangent vector to the lift of curve to the frame bundle define by parallel transport the frame bundle also come equip with a solder form which be in the sense that it vanish on vertical vector such a the point value of the vector field indeed be define first by project a tangent vector to at a frame to then by take the component of this tangent vector on with respect to the frame note that be also where act on by matrix multiplication the pair define a bundle isomorphism of with the trivial bundle where be the cartesian product of and view a the lie algebra of the affine group which be actually a semidirect product see below affine connection can be define within cartan general framework in the modern approach this be closely relate to the definition of affine connection on the frame bundle indeed in one formulation a cartan connection be an absolute parallelism of a principal bundle satisfy suitable property from this point of view the on the frame bundle of an affine manifold be a cartan connection however cartan original approach be different from this in a number of way the concept of frame bundle or principal bundle do not exist a connection be view in term of parallel transport between infinitesimally nearby point this parallel transport be affine rather than linear the object be transport be not tangent vector in the modern sense but element of an affine space with a marked point which the cartan connection ultimately identify with the tangent space and historical the point just raise be easy to explain in reverse start from the motivation provide by surface theory in this situation although the plane be roll over the surface be tangent plane in a naive sense the notion of a tangent space be really an infinitesimal notion whereas the plane a affine subspace of be infinite in extent however these affine plane all have a mark point the point of contact with the surface and they be tangent to the surface at this point the confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identify with it tangent space at that point however the parallel transport define by roll do not fix this origin it be affine rather than linear the linear parallel transport can be recover by apply a translation abstract this idea an affine manifold should therefore be an with an affine space of dimension attach to each at a marked point together with a method for transport element of these affine space along any curve in this method be require to satisfy several property for any two point on parallel transport be an affine transformation from to parallel transport be define infinitesimally in the sense that it be differentiable at any point on and depend only on the tangent vector to at that point the derivative of the parallel transport at determines a linear isomorphism from to these last two point be quite hard to make precise so affine connection be more often define infinitesimally to motivate this it suffice to consider how affine frame of reference transform infinitesimally with respect to parallel transport this be the origin of cartan method of move frame an affine frame at a point consist of a list where and the form a basis of the affine connection be then give symbolically by a first order differential system define by a collection of geometrically an affine frame undergo a displacement travel along a curve from to give approximately or infinitesimally by furthermore the affine space be require to be tangent to in the informal sense that the displacement of along can be identify approximately or infinitesimally with the tangent vector to at which be the infinitesimal displacement of since where be define by this identification be give by so the requirement be that should be a linear isomorphism at each point the tangential affine space be thus identify intuitively with an infinitesimal affine neighborhood of the modern point of view make all this intuition more precise use principal bundle the essential idea be to replace a frame or a variable frame by the space of all frame and function on this space it also draw on the inspiration of felix klein erlangen programme in which a geometry be define to be a homogeneous space affine space be a geometry in this sense and be equip with a flat cartan connection thus a general affine manifold be view a curved deformation of the flat model geometry of affine space space a the flat model of an affine informally an space be a vector space without a fixed choice of origin it describe the geometry of point and free vector in space a a consequence of the lack of origin point in affine space can not be add together a this require a choice of origin with which to form the parallelogram law for vector addition however a vector may be add to a point by place the initial point of the vector at and then transport to the terminal point the operation thus describe be the of along in technical term affine be a set equip with a free transitive action of the vector group on it through this operation of translation of point be thus a principal homogeneous space for the vector group the general linear group be the group of transformation of which preserve the linear structure of in the sense that by analogy the group be the group of transformation of preserve the affine structure thus must preserve translation in the sense that where be a general linear transformation the map send to be a group homomorphism it kernel be the group of translation the stabilizer of any point in can thus be identify with use this projection this realise the affine group a a semidirect product of and and affine space a the homogeneous space frame and the flat affine an affine frame for consists of a point and a basis of the vector space the general linear group act freely on the set of all affine frame by fix and transform the basis in the usual way and the map send an affine frame to be the quotient map thus be a principal over the action of extends naturally to a free transitive action of the affine group on so that be an and the choice of a reference frame identifies with the principal bundle on there be a collection of function define by a before and after choose a basepoint for these be all function with value in so it be possible to take their exterior derivative to obtain differential with value in since the function yield a basis for at each point of these must be expressible a sum of the form for some collection of on this system of on the principal bundle define the affine connection on take the exterior derivative a second time and use the fact that as well a the linear independence of the the following relation be obtain these be the equation for the lie group identify with by the choice of a reference frame furthermore the pfaffian system for all be integrable and it integral manifold be the fibre of the principal bundle the pfaffian system for all be also integrable and it integral manifold define parallel transport in thus the form define a flat principal connection on for a strict comparison with the motivation one should actually define parallel transport in a principal over this can be do by pull back by the smooth map define by translation then the composite be a principal over and the form pull back to give a flat principal on this bundle affine geometry formal an affine space a with essentially any smooth klein geometry be a manifold equip with a flat cartan connection more general affine manifold or affine geometry be obtain easily by drop the flatness condition express by the equation there be several way to approach the definition and two will be give both definition be facilitate by the realisation that in the flat model fit together to give a with value in the lie algebra of the affine group in these definition be a smooth and be an affine space of the same dimension via absolute let be a manifold and a principal over then an connection be a on with value in satisfy the following property be equivariant with respect to the action of on and for all in the lie algebra of all matrix be a linear isomorphism of each tangent space of with the last condition mean that be an parallelism on it identify the tangent bundle of with a trivial bundle in this case the pair define the structure of an geometry on make it into an manifold the affine lie algebra split a a semidirect product of and and so may be write a a pair where take value in and take value in condition and be equivalent to be a principal and be a horizontal equivariant which induce a bundle homomorphism from to the associate bundle condition be equivalent to the fact that this bundle homomorphism be an isomorphism however this decomposition be a consequence of the rather special structure of the affine group since be the frame bundle of it follow that provide a bundle isomorphism between and the frame bundle of this recover the definition of an affine connection a a principal on the arising in the flat model be just the component of and a a principal affine an connection on be a principal over together with a principal of and a principal a on with value in which satisfy the follow generic cartan condition the component of pullback of to be a horizontal equivariant and so define a bundle homomorphism from to this be require to be an isomorphism to the since act on there be associate to the principal bundle a bundle which be a fiber bundle over whose fiber at in be an affine space a section of define a marked point in for each determines a principal of a the bundle of stabilizer of these mark point and vice versa the principal connection define an ehresmann connection on this bundle hence a notion of parallel transport the cartan condition ensure that the distinguished section always move under parallel transport and curvature and torsion be the main invariant of an affine connection a there be many equivalent way to define the notion of an affine connection so there be many different way to define curvature and torsion from the cartan connection point of view the curvature be the failure of the affine connection to satisfy the equation where the second term on the left hand side be the wedge product use the lie bracket in to contract the value by expand into the pair and use the structure of the lie algebra this leave hand side can be expand into the two formula where the wedge product be evaluate use matrix multiplication the first expression be call the torsion of the connection and the second be also call the curvature these expression be differential on the total space of a frame bundle however they be horizontal and equivariant and hence define tensorial object these can be define directly from the induced covariant derivative on a follow the torsion be give by the formula if the torsion vanish the connection be say to be or symmetric the curvature be give by the formula note that be the lie bracket of vector field in einstein notation this be independent of coordinate system choice and the tangent vector at point of the th coordinate curve the be a natural basis for the tangent space at point and the the corresponding coordinate for the vector field when both curvature and torsion vanish the connection define a algebra structure on the space of global section of the tangent bundle if be a riemannian manifold then there be a unique affine connection on with the follow two property the connection be be zero parallel transport be an isometry the inner product define use between tangent vector be preserve this connection be call the connection the second condition mean that the connection be a connection in the sense that the riemannian metric be parallel in local coordinate the component of the connection form be call christoffel symbol because of the uniqueness of the connection there be a formula for these component in term of the component of since straight line be a concept in affine geometry affine connection define a generalized notion of parametrized straight line on any affine manifold call affine geodesic abstractly a parametric curve be a straight line if it tangent vector remain parallel and equipollent with itself when it be transport along from the linear point of view an affine connection distinguish the affine geodesic in the following way a smooth curve be an geodesic if be parallel transport along that be where be the parallel transport map define the connection in term of the infinitesimal connection the derivative of this equation imply for all conversely any solution of this differential equation yield a curve whose tangent vector be parallel transport along the curve for every and every there exist a unique affine geodesic with and and where be the maximal open interval in contain on which the geodesic be define this follow from the theorem and allow for the definition of an exponential map associate to the affine connection in particular when be a riemannian manifold and be the connection then the affine geodesic be the usual geodesic of riemannian geometry and be the locally distance minimize curve the geodesic define here be sometimes call parametrized since a give straight line in determines a parametric curve through the line up to a choice of affine reparametrization where and be constant the tangent vector to an affine geodesic be parallel and equipollent along itself an unparametrized geodesic or one which be merely parallel along itself without necessarily be equipollent need only satisfy for some function define along unparametrized geodesic be often study from the point of view of projective connection an affine connection define a notion of of curve intuitively development capture the notion that if be a curve in then the affine tangent space at may be roll along the curve a it do so the marked point of contact between the tangent space and the manifold trace out a curve in this affine space the development of in formal term let be the linear parallel transport map associate to the affine connection then the development be the curve in start off at and be parallel to the tangent of for all time in particular be a geodesic if and only if it development be an affinely parametrized straight line in if be a surface in it be easy to see that have a natural affine connection from the linear connection point of view the covariant derivative of a vector field be define by differentiate the vector field view a a map from to and then project the result orthogonally back onto the tangent space of it be easy to see that this affine connection be furthermore it be a metric connection with respect to the riemannian metric on induce by the inner product on hence it be the connection of this metric the unit sphere in euclidean let be the usual scalar product on and let be the unit sphere the tangent space to at a point be naturally identify with the vector subspace of consist of all vector orthogonal to it follow that a vector field on can be see a a map which satisfy denote a the differential jacobian matrix of such a map then we have lemma the formula define an affine connection on with vanish torsion proof it be straightforward to prove that satisfy the leibniz identity and be linear in the first variable so all that need to be prove here be that the map above do indeed define a tangent vector field that be we need to prove that for all in consider the map the map f be constant hence it differential vanishes in particular equation

tertiary structure of human cyclin a lack the amino acid show the central core of two bundle with additional helix at the amino terminus black and carboxyl terminus grey the yellow region in helix be the mrail sequence or hydrophobic patch which contribute to the recognition of some substrate pdb cyclin be a family of protein that control the progression of a cell through the cell cycle by activate kinase cdk enzymes or group of enzyme require for synthesis of cell cycle cyclins be originally discover by timothy hunt in while study the cell cycle of sea urchin in an interview for the life scientific air on host by jim timothy hunt explain that the name cyclin be originally name after his hobby cycle it be only after the naming do it importance in the cell cycle become apparent a it be appropriate the name stick timothy hunt by the way the name cyclin which i coin be really a joke it because i like cycle so much at the time but they do come and go in the cell expression of human cyclins through the cell cycle cyclins be originally name because their concentration varies in a cyclical fashion during the cell cycle note that the cyclins be now classified accord to their conserve cyclin box structure and not all these cyclins alter in level through the cell cycle the oscillation of the cyclins namely fluctuation in cyclin gene expression and destruction by the ubiquitin mediate proteasome pathway induce oscillation in cdk activity to drive the cell cycle a cyclin form a complex with cdk which begin to activate but the complete activation require phosphorylation as well complex formation result in activation of the cdk active site cyclins themselves have no enzymatic activity but have bind site for some substrate and target the cdks to specific subcellular location cyclins when bound with the dependent kinase such a the protein form the factor mpfs activate other protein through phosphorylation these phosphorylated protein in turn be responsible for specific event during cycle division such a microtubule formation and chromatin remodeling cyclins can be divide into four class base on their behavior in the cell cycle of vertebrate somatic cell and yeast cell cyclins cyclins s cyclins and m cyclins this division be useful when talk about most cell cycle but it be not universal a some cyclins have different function or time in different cell type cyclins rise in late and fall in early s phase the cyclin complex begin to induce the initial process of dna replication primarily by arrest system that prevent s phase cdk activity in the cyclins also promote other activity to progress the cell cycle such a centrosome duplication in vertebrate or spindle pole body in yeast the rise in presence of cyclins be parallel by a rise in s cyclins cyclins do not behave like the other cyclins in that the concentration increase gradually with no oscillation throughout the cell cycle base on cell growth and the external signal the presence of g cyclins coordinate cell growth with the entry to a new cell cycle s cyclins bind to cdk and the complex directly induce dna replication the level of s cyclins remain high not only throughout s phase but through and early mitosis as well to promote early event in mitosis m cyclin concentration rise a the cell begin to enter mitosis and the concentration peak at metaphase cell change in the cell cycle like the assembly of mitotic spindle and alignment of along the spindle be induce by m cdk complexes the destruction of m cyclins during metaphase and anaphase after the spindle assembly checkpoint be satisfied cause the exit of mitosis and cytokinesis expression of cyclins detect immunocytochemically in individual cell in relation to cellular dna content cell cycle phase or in relation to initiation and termination of dna replication during can be measure by flow kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus kshv encode a cyclin that bind and be likely to contribute to cancer cyclins be generally very different from each other in primary structure or amino acid sequence however all member of the cyclin family be similar in amino acid that make up the cyclin box cyclins contain two domain of a similar fold the first locate at the and the second at the all cyclins be believe to contain a similar tertiary structure of two compact domain of α helix the first of which be the conserved cyclin box outside of which cyclins be divergent for example the region of s and m cyclins contain short motif that target these protein for proteolysis in mitosis there be several different cyclins that be active in different part of the cell cycle and that cause the cdk to phosphorylate different substrate there be also several orphan cyclins for which no cdk partner have be identify for example cyclin f be an orphan cyclin that be essential for transition a study in c elegans reveal the specific role of mitotic cyclins notably recent study have show that cyclin a create a cellular environment that promote microtubule detachment from kinetochore in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation cell must separate their chromosome precisely an event that rely on the attachment of chromosome to spindle microtubule through specialized structure call kinetochore in the early phase of division there be numerous error in how kinetochore bind to spindle microtubule the unstable attachment promote the correction of error by cause a constant detachment realignment and reattachment of microtubule from kinetochore in the cell a they try to find the correct attachment protein cyclin a governs this process by keep the process go until the error be eliminate in normal cell persistent cyclin a expression prevent the stabilization of microtubule bind to kinetochore even in cell with aligned chromosome a level of cyclin a decline microtubule attachments become stable allow the chromosome to be divide correctly a cell division proceeds in contrast in cyclin cell microtubule attachment be prematurely stabilize consequently these cell may fail to correct error lead to high rate of chromosome main group there be two main group of cyclins cyclins essential for the control of the cell cycle at the transition cyclin a active in s phase cyclin d cyclin d and cyclin e regulate transition from to s phase cyclins

in mathematics the equation be a necessary condition describe extremal geometry in generalization of problem from the calculus of variation and be a special case of the equation it be name for william rowan hamilton and carl gustav jacob jacobi in physic the equation be an alternative formulation of classical mechanic equivalent to other formulation such a newton law of motion lagrangian mechanic and hamiltonian mechanic the equation be particularly useful in identify conserved quantity for mechanical system which may be possible even when the mechanical problem itself can not be solve completely the hje be also the only formulation of mechanic in which the motion of a particle can be represent a a wave in this sense the hje fulfil a goal of theoretical physic date at least to johann bernoulli in the century of find an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle the wave equation follow by mechanical system be similar to but not identical with schrödinger equation a describe below for this reason the hje be consider the close approach of classical mechanic to quantum mechanic boldface variable such a represent a list of generalized coordinate a dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative see newton notation the dot product notation between two list of the same number of coordinate be a shorthand for the sum of the product of correspond component give the hamiltonian of a mechanical system where be coordinate and momentum of the system and be time the equation be write a a partial differential equation for the principal function the hamilton principal function be define a the function of the upper limit of the action integral take along the minimal action trajectory of the system where be the lagrangian of the system and where the trajectory satisfy the equation of the system calculate the variation of with respect to variation of the coordinate lead to use this result and calculate the variation of with respect to variation of the time of the lead directly to the equation or where be the change of the trajectory at the old due to the time shift and where be the hamiltonian of the system alternatively a describe below the equation may be derive from hamiltonian mechanic by treat s a the generate function for a canonical transformation of the classical hamiltonian the conjugate momentum correspond to the first derivative of s with respect to the generalized coordinate a a solution to the equation the principal function contains n undetermined constant the first n of them denote a α α αn and the last one come from the integration of the relationship between and then describe the orbit in phase space in term of these constant of motion furthermore the quantity be also constant of motion and these equation can be invert to find a a function of all the α and β constant and time the hje be a single partial differential equation for the function s of the n generalized coordinate q and the time t the generalized momentum do not appear except a derivative of s remarkably the function s be equal to the classical action for comparison in the equivalent equation of motion of lagrangian mechanic the conjugate momentum also do not appear however those equation be a system of n generally equation for the time evolution of the generalized coordinate similarly hamilton equation of motion be another system of n equation for the time evolution of the generalized coordinate and their conjugate momentum p since the hje be an equivalent expression of an integral minimization problem such a hamilton principle the hje can be useful in other problem of the calculus of variation and more generally in other branch of mathematics and physic such a dynamical system symplectic geometry and quantum chaos for example the equation can be use to determine the geodesic on a riemannian manifold an important variational problem in riemannian geometry the hje establish a duality between trajectory and wave front for example in geometrical optic light can be consider either a or wave the wave front can be define a the surface that the light emit at time have reach at time light ray and wave front be dual if one be know the other can be deduce more precisely geometrical optic be a variational problem where the be the travel time along a path where be the index of the medium and be an infinitesimal arc length from the above formulation one can compute the ray path use the formulation alternatively one can compute the wave front by solve the equation know one lead to know the other the above duality be very general and applies to all system that derive from a variational principle either compute the trajectory use equation or the wave front by use equation the wave front at time for a system initially at at time be define a the collection of point such that if be know the momentum be immediately deduced once be known tangent to the trajectory be compute by solve the equation for where be the lagrangian the trajectory be then recover from the knowledge of any canonical transformation involve a generate function g t lead to the relation and hamilton equation in term of the new variable and new hamiltonian k have the same form to derive the hje we choose a generating function g t in such a way that it will make the new hamiltonian k hence all it derivative be also zero and the transformed hamilton equation become trivial so the new generalize coordinate and momentum be constant of motion a they be constant in this context the new generalize momentum be usually denote α α αn αm and the new generalize coordinate be typically denote a β β βn so qm βm set the generate function equal to hamilton principal function plus an arbitrary constant a the hje automatically arise once we have solve for s t these also give u the useful equation or write in component for clarity ideally these n equation can be invert to find the original generalized coordinate a a function of the constant and t thus solve the original problem hamilton principal function s and classical function h be both closely relate to action the total differential of s be so the time derivative of s be therefore so s be actually the classical action plus an undetermined constant when h do not explicitly depend on time in this case w be the same a action the hje be most useful when it can be solve via additive separation of variable which directly identify constant of motion for example the time t can be separate if the hamiltonian do not depend on time explicitly in that case the time derivative in the hje must be a constant usually denote e give the separated solution where the function w be sometimes call characteristic function the reduced equation can then be write to illustrate separability for other variable we assume that a certain generalized coordinate qk and it derivative appear together a a single function in the hamiltonian in that case the function s can be partition into two function one that depend only on qk and another that depend only on the remain generalized coordinate substitution of these formula into the equation show that the function ψ must be a constant denote here a γ k yield a ordinary differential equation for s q in fortunate case the function s can be separate completely into n function sm qm in such a case the problem devolve to n ordinary differential equation the separability of s depend both on the hamiltonian and on the choice of generalized coordinate for orthogonal coordinate and hamiltonians that have no time dependence and be quadratic in the generalized momentum s will be completely separable if the potential energy be additively separable in each coordinate where the potential energy term for each coordinate be multiply by the factor in the corresponding momentum term of the hamiltonian the condition for illustration several example in orthogonal coordinate be work in the next section in spherical coordinate the hamiltonian of a free particle move in a conservative potential u can be write the equation be completely separable in these coordinate provide that there exist function ur r uθ θ and uϕ ϕ such that u can be write in the analogous form substitution of the completely separated solution into the hje yield this equation may be solve by successive integration of ordinary differential equation begin with the equation for ϕ where γ ϕ be a constant of the motion that eliminate the ϕ dependence from the equation the next ordinary differential equation involve the θ generalize coordinate where γ θ be again a constant of the motion that eliminate the θ dependence and reduce the hje to the final ordinary differential equation whose integration complete the solution for s cylindrical the hamiltonian in elliptic cylindrical coordinate can be write where the focus of the ellipsis be locate at on the the equation be completely separable in these coordinate provide that u have an analogous form where and be arbitrary function substitution of the completely separated solution into the hje yield separate the first ordinary differential equation yield the reduced equation after and multiplication of both side by the denominator which itself may be separate into two independent ordinary differential equation that when solve provide a complete solution for s cylindrical the hamiltonian in parabolic cylindrical coordinate can be write the equation be completely separable in these coordinate provide that u have an analogous form where uσ σ uτ τ and uz z be arbitrary function substitution of the completely separated solution into the hje yield separate the first ordinary differential equation yield the reduced equation after and multiplication of both side by the denominator which itself may be separate into two independent ordinary differential equation that when solve provide a complete solution for s the isosurfaces of the function s t can be determine at any time t the motion of an s a a function of time be define by the motion of the particle begin at the point on the isosurface the motion of such an isosurface can be think of a a wave move through space although it do not obey the wave equation exactly to show this let s represent the phase of a wave where ħ be a constant planck constant introduce to make the exponential argument dimensionless change in the amplitude of the wave can be represent by have s be a complex number we may then rewrite the equation a which be the schrödinger equation conversely start with the schrödinger equation and our ansatz for ψ we arrive at the classical limit ħ of the schrödinger equation above becomes identical to the follow variant of the equation use the relation in the form for

follow for two scalar field and the lagrangian have the form which can be write more concisely introduce a complex scalar field define a express in term of this scalar field the above lagrangian becomes which be thus equivalent to the so model of real scalar field a can be see by expand the complex field in real and imaginary part with real scalar field we can have a model with a global so n symmetry give by the lagrangian expand the complex field in real and imaginary part show that it be equivalent to the so model of real scalar field in all of the model above the coupling constant must be positive since otherwise the potential would be unbounded below and there would be no stable vacuum also the feynman path integral discuss below would be in dimension theory have a landau pole this mean that without a on the scale renormalization would render the theory trivial the feynman diagram expansion may be obtain also from the feynman path integral formulation the time order vacuum expectation value of polynomial in φ known a the n green function be construct by integrate over all possible field normalize by the vacuum expectation value with no external field all of these green function may be obtain by expand the exponential in j x φ x in the generating function a wick rotation may be apply to make time imaginary change the signature to then give a statistical mechanic integral over a euclidean space normally this be apply to the scattering of particle with fixed momentum in which case a fourier transform be useful give instead where be the dirac delta function the standard trick to evaluate this functional integral be to write it a a product of exponential factor schematically the second two exponential factor can be expand a power series and the combinatorics of this expansion can be represent graphically the integral with λ can be treat a a product of infinitely many elementary gaussian integral and the result may be express a a sum of feynman diagram calculate use the following feynman rule each field in the n euclidean green function be represent by an external line in the graph and associate with momentum p each vertex be represent by a factor at a give order λ k all diagram with n external line and k vertex be construct such that the momentum flow into each vertex be zero each internal line be represent by a factor q m where q be the momentum flow through that line any unconstrained momentum be integrate over all value the result be divide by a symmetry factor which be the number of way the line and vertex of the graph can be rearrange without change it connectivity do not include graph contain vacuum bubble connect subgraphs with no external line the last rule take into account the effect of dividing by the feynman rule be similar except that each vertex be represent by while each internal line be represent by a factor i q m i where the ε term represent the small wick rotation need to make the gaussian integral converge the integral over unconstrained momentum call loop integral in the feynman graph typically diverge this be normally handle by renormalization which be a procedure of add divergent to the lagrangian in such a way that the diagram construct from the original lagrangian and counterterms be finite a renormalization scale must be introduce in the process and the coupling constant and mass become dependent upon it it be this dependence that lead to the landau pole mention earlier and require that the cutoff be keep finite alternatively if the cutoff be allow to go to infinity the landau pole can be avoid only if the renormalized coupling run to zero render the theory trivial an interesting feature can occur if m turn negative but with λ still positive in this case the vacuum consist of two state each of which spontaneously break the global symmetry of the original theory this lead to the appearance of interest collective state like domain wall in the o theory the vacuum would lie on a circle and the choice of one would spontaneously break the o symmetry a continuous broken symmetry lead to a goldstone boson this type of spontaneous symmetry breaking be the essential component of the higgs mechanism breaking of discrete the simple relativistic system in which we can see spontaneous symmetry breaking be one with a single scalar field with lagrangian where and minimize the potential with respect to lead to we now expand the field around this minimum writing and substituting in the lagrangian we get where we notice that the scalar have now a positive mass term think in term of vacuum expectation value let u understand what happen to a symmetry when it be spontaneously break the original lagrangian be invariant under the symmetry since be both minimum there must be two different vacuum with since the symmetry take it must take as well the two possible vacuum for the theory be equivalent but one have to be choose although it seem that in the new lagrangian the symmetry have disappear it be still there but it now act a this be a general feature of spontaneously break symmetries the vacuum break them but they be not actually break in the lagrangian just hide and often realize only in a nonlinear way there exist a set of exact classical solution to the equation of motion of the theory write in the form that can be write for the massless case a with a jacobi elliptic function and two integration constant provide the following dispersion relation hold the interesting point be that we start with a massless equation but the exact solution describe a wave with a dispersion relation proper to a massive solution when the mass term be not zero one get be now the dispersion relation finally for the case of a symmetry break one have be and the following dispersion relation hold these wave solution be interest a notwithstanding we start with an equation with a wrong mass sign the dispersion relation have the right one besides jacobi function have no real zero and so the field be never zero but move around a give constant value that be initially choose describe a spontaneous breaking of symmetry a proof of uniqueness can be provide if we note that the solution can be seek in the form be then the partial differential equation become an ordinary differential equation that be the one define the jacobi elliptic function with satisfy the proper dispersion relation field theory triviality pole mechanism boson hooft the conceptual basis of quantum field theory online version,Quartic interaction,Subfields of physics,Particle physics
tortoiseshell and calico cat be a visible manifestation of the black and orange allele of a fur coloration gene reside on the x chromosome for any give patch of fur the inactivation of an x chromosome

show in yellow color mark both active and inactive xa xi the nucleus be show in blue color the figure be adapt from also call after english geneticist mary lyon be a process by which one of the copy of the x chromosome be inactivate in therian female mammal the inactive x chromosome be silence by it be package into a transcriptionally inactive structure call heterochromatin a nearly all female mammal have two x chromosome prevent them from have twice as many x chromosome gene product a male who only possess a single copy of the x chromosome see dosage compensation the choice of which x chromosome will be inactivate be random in placental mammal such a human but once an x chromosome be inactivate it will remain inactive throughout the lifetime of the cell and it descendant in the organism unlike the random in placental mammal inactivation in marsupial applies exclusively to the x chromosome cycle of activation the paragraph below have to do only with rodent and do not reflect xi in the majority of mammal be part of the activation cycle of the x chromosome throughout the female life the egg and the fertilized zygote initially use maternal transcript and the whole embryonic genome be silence until zygotic genome activation thereafter all mouse cell undergo an early imprinted inactivation of the x chromosome in cell stage embryos the extraembryonic tissue which give rise to the placenta and other tissue support the embryo retain this early imprinted inactivation and thus only the maternal x chromosome be active in these tissue in the early blastocyst this initial imprint be reverse in the cell of the inner cell mass which give rise to the embryo and in these cell both x chromosomes become active again each of these cell then independently and randomly inactivate one copy of the x chromosome this inactivation event be irreversible during the lifetime of the individual with the exception of the germline in the female germline before meiotic entry be reverse so that after meiosis all haploid oocyte contain a single active x chromosome overview the mark the inactive the active x chromosome xp denote the paternal and to denote the maternal x chromosome when the egg carrying be fertilize by a sperm carry a y or an a diploid zygote form from zygote through adult stage to the next generation of egg the x chromosome undergo the following change xip xim zygote undergo zygotic genome activation lead to undergoing paternal lead to xip undergoing in the early blastocyst stage lead to xam undergoing in the embryonic lineage inner cell mass in the blastocyst stage lead to xip or xim undergoing in primordial germ cell before meiosis lead to diploid germ cell in meiotic arrest a the meiosis i only complete with ovulation human germ cell exist in this stage from the first week of development until puberty the completion of meiosis lead to and haploid germ cell egg the x activation cycle have be best study in mouse but there be multiple study in human a most of the evidence be come from mice the above scheme represent the event in mouse the completion of the meiosis be simplify here for clarity step can be study in in vitro fertilize embryo and in differentiate stem cell happen in the developing embryo and subsequent step inside the female body therefore much hard to study time the timing of each process depend on the specie and in many case the precise time be actively debated timing of major event in the x chromosome activation cycle process mouse human zygotic genome activation cell stage cell stage imprint paternal cell stage unclear if it take place in human early blastocyst stage early blastocyst stage random in the embryonic lineage inner cell mass late blastocyst stage late blastocyst stage after implantation in primordial germ cell before meiosis from before developmental week up to week inheritance of inactivation status across cell generation the descendant of each cell which inactivate a particular x chromosome will also inactivate that same chromosome this phenomenon which can be observe in the coloration of tortoiseshell cat when female be heterozygous for the gene should not be confuse with mosaicism which be a term that specifically refer to difference in the genotype of various cell population in the same individual which be an epigenetic change that result in a different phenotype be not a change at the genotypic level for an individual cell or lineage the inactivation be therefore skewed or and this can give rise to mild symptom in female of genetic disorder of one active x normal female possess two x chromosome and in any give cell one chromosome will be active designate a xa and one will be inactive xi however study of individual with extra copy of the x chromosome show that in cell with more than two x chromosome there be still only one xa and all the remain x chromosome be inactivate this indicate that the default state of the x chromosome in female be inactivation but one x chromosome be always select to remain active it be understood that inactivation be a random process occur at about the time of gastrulation in the epiblast cell that will give rise to the embryo the maternal and paternal x chromosome have an equal probability of inactivation this would suggest that woman would be expect to suffer from disorder approximately as often a men because woman have two x chromosome while men have only one however in actuality the occurrence of these disorder in female be much low than that one explanation for this disparity be that of gene on the inactivated x chromosome remain expressed thus provide woman with added protection against defective gene cod by the some suggest that this disparity must be evidence of preferential inactivation preferential inactivation of the paternal occurs in both marsupial and in cell lineage that form the membrane surround the embryo whereas in placental mammal either the maternally or the paternally derive may be inactivate in different cell line the time period for inactivation explain this disparity inactivation occur in the epiblast during gastrulation which give rise to the embryo inactivation occur on a cellular level result in a mosaic expression in which patch of cell have an inactive maternal while other patch have an inactive paternal for example a female heterozygous for haemophilia an disease would have about half of her liver cell function properly which be typically enough to ensure normal blood clot chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cell however such statistical extreme be unlikely genetic difference on the chromosome may also render one more likely to undergo inactivation also if one have a mutation hinder it growth or render it non viable cell which randomly inactivate that x will have a selective advantage over cell which randomly inactivate the normal allele thus although inactivation be initially random cell that inactivate a normal allele leave the mutate allele active will eventually be overgrow and replace by functionally normal cell in which nearly all have the same activate it be hypothesize that there be an factor which bind to the x chromosome and prevent it inactivation the model postulate that there be a limit blocking factor so once the available blocking factor molecule bind to one x chromosome the remain x chromosome s be not protect from inactivation this model be support by the existence of a single xa in cell with many x chromosome and by the existence of two active x chromosome in cell line with twice the normal number of autosome sequence at the inactivation center present on the x chromosome control the silencing of the x chromosome the hypothetical blocking factor be predict to bind to sequence within the xic expression of disorder in heterozygous female the effect of female x heterozygosity be apparent in some localized trait such a the unique coat pattern of a calico cat it can be more difficult however to fully understand the expression of trait in these female such a the expression of disease since male only have one copy of the x chromosome all express gene or allele in the case of multiple variant form for a give gene in the population be locate on that copy of the chromosome females however will primarily express the gene or allele locate on the copy that remain active consider the situation for one gene or multiple gene cause individual difference in a particular phenotype cause variation observe in the population for that phenotype in homozygous female it do particularly matter which copy of the chromosome be inactivate a the allele on both copy be the same however in female that be heterozygous at the causal gene the inactivation of one copy of the chromosome over the other can have a direct impact on their phenotypic value because of this phenomenon there be an observed increase in phenotypic variation in female that be heterozygous at the involved gene or gene than in female that be homozygous at that gene or those gene there be many different way in which the phenotypic variation can play out in many case heterozygous female may be asymptomatic or only present minor symptom of a give disorder such a with adrenoleukodystrophy the differentiation of phenotype in heterozygous female be further by the presence of skew typically each be silence in half of the cell but this process be skew when preferential inactivation of a chromosome occurs it be think that skew happens either by chance or by a physical characteristic of a chromosome that may cause it to be silence more or less often such a an unfavorable mutation on average each x chromosome be inactivate in half of the cell however of apparently normal woman display skew in case where skewing be present a broad range of symptom expression can occur result in expression vary from minor to severe depend on the skew proportion an extreme case of this be see where monozygotic female twin have extreme variance in expression of menkes disease an disorder result in the death of one twin while the other remain asymptomatic it be think that skew could be cause by issue in the mechanism that cause inactivation or by issue in the chromosome itself however the link between phenotype and skewing be still be question and should be examine on a basis a study look at both symptomatic and asymptomatic female who be heterozygous for duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy dmd find no apparent link between transcript expression and skew the study suggest that both mechanism be independently regulate and there be other unknown factor at play the center or simply xic on the x chromosome be necessary and sufficient to cause chromosomal translocation which place the xic on an autosome lead to inactivation of the autosome and x chromosome lack the xic be not inactivate the xic contain four rna gene xist tsix jpx and ftx which be involve in the xic also contain bind site for both know and unknown regulatory protein and tsix the specific transcript xist gene encode a large rna that be responsible for mediate the specific silencing of the x chromosome from which it be transcribe the inactive x chromosome be coat by xist rna whereas the xa be not see figure to the right x chromosome that lack the xist gene can not be inactivate artificially place and express the xist gene on another chromosome lead to silencing of that chromosome prior to inactivation both x chromosome weakly express xist rna from the xist gene during the inactivation process the future xa cease to express xist whereas the future xi dramatically increase xist rna production on the future xi the xist rna progressively coat the chromosome spread out from the xic the xist rna do not localize to the xa the silencing of gene along the xi occur soon after coat by xist rna like xist the tsix gene encode a large rna which be not believe to encode a protein the tsix rna be transcribe antisense to xist meaning that the tsix gene overlap the xist gene and be transcribe on the opposite strand of dna from the xist gene tsix be a negative regulator of xist x chromosome lack tsix expression and thus have high level of xist transcription be inactivate much more frequently than normal chromosome like xist prior to inactivation both x chromosome weakly express tsix rna from the tsix gene upon the onset of the future xi cease to express tsix rna and increase xist expression whereas xa continue to express tsix for several day rep a be a long non cod rna that work with another long non cod rna xist for x inactivation rep a inhibit the function of tsix the antisense of xist in conjunction with eliminate expression of xite it promote methylation of the tsix region by attract and thus inactivate one of the x chromosomes the inactive x chromosome do not express the majority of it gene unlike the active x chromosome this be due to the silencing of the xi by repressive heterochromatin which compact the xi dna and prevent the expression of most gene compare to the xa the xi have high level of dna methylation low level of histone acetylation low level of histone methylation and high level of histone methylation and methylation mark which be place by the complex recruit by xist all of which be associate with gene silence regulates chromatin compaction and chromatin remodeling in several process include the dna damage response additionally a histone variant call be exclusively find on nucleosomes along the xi dna package in heterochromatin such a the xi be more condensed than dna package in euchromatin such a the xa the inactive x form a discrete body within the nucleus call a barr body the barr body be generally locate on the periphery of the nucleus be late replicating within the cell cycle and a it contain the xi contain heterochromatin modification and the xist rna gene on the inactive x a fraction of the gene along the x chromosome escape inactivation on the xi the xist gene be express at high level on the xi and be not express on the xa many other gene escape inactivation some be express equally from the xa and xi and others while express from both chromosome be still predominantly express from the xa up to one quarter of gene on the human xi be capable of escape study in the mouse suggest that in any give cell type to of gene escape inactivation and that escape gene identity varies between tissue many of the gene which escape inactivation be present along region of the x chromosome which unlike the majority of the x chromosome contain gene also present on the y chromosome these region be term pseudoautosomal region a individual of either sex will receive two copy of every gene in these region like an autosome unlike the majority of gene along the sex chromosome since individual of either sex will receive two copy of every gene in a pseudoautosomal region no dosage compensation be need for female so it be postulate that these region of dna have evolve mechanism to escape the gene of pseudoautosomal region of the xi do not have the typical modification of the xi and have little xist rna bound the existence of gene along the inactive x which be not silence explain the defect in human with abnormal number of the x chromosome such a turner syndrome or klinefelter syndrome xxy theoretically should eliminate the difference in gene dosage between affected individual and individual with a normal chromosome complement in affected individual however be incomplete and the dosage of these gene will differ a they escape similar to an autosomal aneuploidy the precise mechanism that control escape from be not know but silence and escape region have be show to have distinct chromatin mark it have be suggest that escape from might be mediate by expression of long rna lncrna within the escape chromosomal domain stanley michael gartler use inactivation to demonstrate the clonal origin of cancer examine normal tissue and tumor from female heterozygous for isoenzymes of the gene demonstrate that tumor cell from such individual express only one form of whereas normal tissue be compose of a nearly equal mixture of cell express the two different phenotype this pattern suggest that a single cell and not a population grow into a cancer however this pattern have be prove wrong for many cancer type suggest that some cancer may be polyclonal in origin besides measure the methylation inactivation status of the polymorphic human androgen receptor humara locate on be consider the most accurate method to assess clonality in female cancer biopsies a great variety of tumor be test by this method some such a renal cell carcinoma find monoclonal while others mesothelioma be report polyclonal researcher have also investigate use inactivation to silence the activity of autosomal chromosome for example jiang et al insert a copy of the xist gene into one copy of chromosome in stem cell derive from an individual with trisomy down syndrome the inserted xist gene induces barr body formation trigger stable heterochromatin modification and silence most of the gene on the extra copy of chromosome in these modified stem cell the gene silence seem to reverse some of the defect associate with down syndrome in susumu ohno show that the two x chromosome of mammal be different one appear similar to the autosome the other be condense and heterochromatic this finding suggest independently to two group of investigator that one of the x chromosome underwent inactivation in mary lyon propose the random inactivation of one female x chromosome to explain the mottled phenotype of female mouse heterozygous for coat color gene the lyon hypothesis also account for the finding that one copy of the x chromosome in female cell be highly condense and that mouse with only one copy of the x chromosome develop a infertile female this suggest to ernest beutler study heterozygous female for dehydrogenase deficiency that there be two red cell population of erythrocyte in such heterozygote deficient cell and normal cell depend on whether the inactivated x chromosome in the nucleus of the red cell precursor cell contain the normal or defective allele system compensation body disorder think to be relate to infantile epileptic encephalopathy type dysplasia,X-inactivation,Branches of

in theoretical physic and mathematics a also call a model be a type of conformal field theory name after julius wess bruno zumino sergei novikov and edward witten a wzw model be associate to a lie group or supergroup and it symmetry algebra be the affine lie algebra build from the correspond lie algebra or lie superalgebra by extension the name wzw model be sometimes use for any conformal field theory whose symmetry algebra be an affine lie algebra for a riemann surface a lie group and a generally complex number let u define the model on at the level the model be a nonlinear sigma model whose action be a functional of a field here be equip with a flat euclidean metric be the partial derivative and be the kill form on the lie algebra of the term of the action be here be the completely tensor and be the lie bracket the term be an integral over a manifold whose boundary be property of the for the term to make sense we need the field to have an extension to this require the homotopy group to be trivial which be the case in particular for any compact lie group the extension of a give to be in general not unique for the wzw model to be should not depend on the choice of the extension the term be invariant under small deformation of and only depend on it homotopy class possible homotopy class be control by the homotopy group for any compact connect simple lie group we have and different extension of lead to value of that differ by integer therefore they lead to the same value of provide the level obeys integer value of the level also play an important role in the representation theory of the model symmetry algebra which be an affine lie algebra if the level be a positive integer the affine lie algebra have unitary high weight representation with high weight that be dominant integral such representation decompose into subrepresentations with respect to the subalgebras span by each simple root the corresponding negative root and their commutator which be a cartan generator in the case of the noncompact simple lie group the homotopy group be trivial and the level be not constrain to be an integer interpretation of the if ea be the basis vector for the lie algebra then be the structure constant of the lie algebra the structure constant be completely and thus they define a on the group manifold of g thus the integrand above be just the pullback of the harmonic to the ball denote the harmonic by c and the pullback by one then have this form lead directly to a topological analysis of the wz term geometrically this term describe the torsion of the respective manifold the presence of this torsion compel teleparallelism of the manifold and thus trivialization of the torsionful curvature tensor and hence arrest of the renormalization flow an infrared fixed point of the renormalization group a phenomenon term group the model be not only symmetric under global transformation by a group element in but also have a much rich symmetry this symmetry be often call the symmetry namely give any holomorphic function and any other completely independent of antiholomorphic function where we have identify and in term of the euclidean space coordinate the following symmetry hold one way to prove the existence of this symmetry be through repeat application of the identity regard product of field the holomorphic and current and be the conserved current associate with this symmetry the singular behaviour of the product of these current with other quantum field determine how those field transform under infintessimal action of the group lie let be a local complex coordinate on an orthonormal basis with respect to the kill form of the lie algebra of and the quantisation of the field we have the following operator product expansion where be the coefficient such that equivalently if be expand in mode then the current algebra generate by be the affine lie algebra associate to the lie algebra of with a level that coincide with the level of the wzw model if the notation for the affine lie algebra be the commutation relation of the affine lie algebra be this affine lie algebra be the chiral symmetry algebra associate to the current a second copy of the same affine lie algebra be associate to the current the generator of that second copy be antiholomorphic the full symmetry algebra of the wzw model be the product of the two copy of the affine lie algebra the sugawara construction be an embedding of the virasoro algebra into the universal envelop algebra of the affine lie algebra the existence of the embedding show that wzw model be conformal field theory moreover it lead to equation for correlation function the sugawara construction be most concisely write at the level of the current for the affine lie algebra and the tensor for the virasoro algebra where the denotes normal ordering and be the dual coxeter number by use the ope of the current and a version of wick theorem one may deduce that the ope of with itself be give by which be equivalent to the virasoro algebra commutation relation the central charge of the virasoro algebra be give in term of the level of the affine lie algebra by at the level of the generator of the affine lie algebra the sugawara construction read where the generator of the virasoro algebra be the mode of the tensor model with compact simply connect if the lie group be compact and simply connect then the wzw model be rational and diagonal rational because the spectrum be build from a finite set of irreducible representation of the affine lie algebra call the integrable high weight representation and diagonal because a representation of the algebra be couple with the same representation of the algebra for example the spectrum of the wzw model at level be where be the affine high weight representation of spin a representation generate by a state such that where be the current that correspond to a generator of the lie algebra of model with other type of if the group be compact but not simply connect the wzw model be rational but not necessarily diagonal for example the wzw model exist for even integer level and it spectrum be a combination of finitely many integrable high weight representation if the group be not compact the wzw model be moreover it spectrum may include non high weight representation for example the spectrum of the wzw model be build from high weight representation plus their image under the spectral flow automorphisms of the affine lie algebra if be a supergroup the spectrum may involve representation that do not factorize a tensor product of representation of the and symmetry algebra this occur for example in the case and also in more complicated supergroups such a representation be responsible for the fact that the corresponding wzw model be logarithmic conformal field theory theory base on affine lie the know conformal field theory base on affine lie algebra be not limit to wzw model for example in the case of the affine lie algebra of the wzw model modular invariant torus partition function obey an ade classification where the wzw model account for the a series only the d series correspond to the wzw model and the e series do not correspond to any wzw model another example be the model this model be base on the same symmetry algebra a the wzw model to which it be relate by wick rotation however the be not strictly speak a wzw model a be not a group but a coset give a simple representation of the lie algebra of an primary field be a field that take value in the representation space of such that an affine primary field be also a primary field for the virasoro algebra that result from the sugawara construction the conformal dimension of the affine primary field be give in term of the quadratic casimir of the representation the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir element where be the inverse of the matrix of the kill form by for example in the wzw model the conformal dimension of a primary field of spin be by the correspondence affine primary field correspond to primary state which be the high weight state of high weight representation of the affine lie algebra if the group be compact the spectrum of the wzw model be make of high weight representation and all correlation function can be deduce from correlation function of affine primary field via ward identity if the riemann surface be the riemann sphere correlation function of affine primary field obey equation on riemann surface of high genus correlation function obey equation which involve derivative not only of the field position but also of the surface modulus give a lie subgroup the wzw model or model be a nonlinear sigma model whose target space be the quotient for the adjoint action of on this gauge wzw model be a conformal field theory whose symmetry algebra be a quotient of the two affine lie algebra of the and wzw model and whose central charge be the difference of their central charge the wzw model whose lie group be the universal cover of the group have be use by juan maldacena and hirosi ooguri to describe bosonic string theory on the sitter space superstring on be describe by the wzw

isotopic labeling or labelling be a technique use to track the passage of an isotope an atom with a detectable variation in neutron count through a reaction metabolic pathway or cell the reactant be by replace specific atom by their isotope the reactant be then allow to undergo the reaction the position of the isotope in the product be measure to determine the sequence the isotopic atom follow in the reaction or the cell metabolic pathway the nuclides use in isotopic labeling may be stable nuclides or radionuclides in the latter case the labeling be call radiolabeling in isotopic labeling there be multiple way to detect the presence of label isotope through their mass vibrational mode or radioactive decay mass spectrometry detect the difference in an isotope mass while infrared spectroscopy detect the difference in the isotope vibrational mode nuclear magnetic resonance detects atoms with different gyromagnetic ratio the radioactive decay can be detect through an ionization chamber or autoradiograph of gel an example of the use of isotopic labeling be the study of phenol in water by replace common hydrogen protium with deuterium label upon add phenol to deuterated water water contain in addition to the usual the substitution of deuterium for the hydrogen be observe in phenol hydroxyl group result in indicate that phenol readily undergoes reaction with water only the hydroxyl group be affect indicate that the other hydrogen atom do not participate in the exchange reactions a label be use to determine the mechanism in the to conversion of the phenyl substitute aryne precursor to acenaphthylene an isotopic tracer also isotopic marker or isotopic label be use in chemistry and biochemistry to help understand chemical reaction and interaction in this technique one or more of the atom of the molecule of interest be substitute for an atom of the same chemical element but of a different isotope like a radioactive isotope use in radioactive tracing because the labeled atom have the same number of proton it will behave in almost exactly the same way a it unlabeled counterpart and with few exception will not interfere with the reaction under investigation the difference in the number of neutron however mean that it can be detect separately from the other atom of the same element nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry m be use to investigate the mechanism of chemical reaction nmr and ms detects isotopic difference which allow information about the position of the label atom in the product structure to be determine with information on the positioning of the isotopic atom in the product the reaction pathway the initial metabolite utilize to convert into the product can be determine radioactive isotope can be test use the autoradiograph of gel in gel electrophoresis the radiation emit by compound contain the radioactive isotope darken a piece of photographic film record the position of the labeled compound relative to one another in the gel isotope tracer be commonly use in the form of isotope ratio by study the ratio between two isotope of the same element we avoid effect involve the overall abundance of the element which usually swamp the much small variation in isotopic abundance isotopic tracer be some of the most important tool in geology because they can be use to understand complex mixing process in earth system further discussion of the application of isotopic tracer in geology be cover under the heading of isotope geochemistry isotopic tracer be usually subdivide into two category stable isotope tracer and radiogenic isotope tracer stable isotope tracer involve only isotope and usually be in theory any element with two stable isotope can be use a an isotopic tracer however the most commonly use stable isotope tracer involve relatively light isotope which readily undergo fractionation in natural system see also isotopic signature a radiogenic isotope tracer involve an isotope produce by radioactive decay which be usually in a ratio with a isotope whose abundance in the earth do not vary due to radioactive decay isotopic trace through reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway the blue circle indicate a labeled carbon atom while white circle be an unlabeled carbon atom stable isotope label involve the use of isotope that can act a a tracer use to model several chemical and biochemical system the chosen isotope can act a a label on that compound that can be identify through nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry ms some of the most common stable isotope be and which can far be produce into nmr solvent amino acid nucleic acid lipid common metabolite and cell growth medium the compound produce use stable isotope be either specify by the percentage of labeled isotope uniformly label glucose contains a mixture that be label with carbon isotope and naturally label carbon or by the specifically labeled carbon position on the compound glucose which be label at the first carbon position of glucose a network of reaction adopt from the glycolysis pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway be show in which the label carbon isotope rearrange to different carbon position throughout the network of reaction the network start with fructose which have carbon atom with a label at carbon position and become two glyceraldehyde one and one unlabeled the can now be react with sedoheptulose to form an unlabeled erythrose and a the unlabeled will react with the to synthesize unlabeled product the figure demonstrate the use of stable isotope label to discover the carbon atom rearrangement through reaction use position specific label compound flux analysis use stable isotope determine the percent of isotope label throughout a reaction if a label and unlabeled metabolite be split in the manner show the expected percent of each outcome can be find the blue circle indicate a labeled atom while a white circle indicate an unlabeled atom metabolic flux analysis mfa use stable isotope labeling be an important tool for explain the flux of certain element through the metabolic pathway and reaction within a cell an isotopic label be feed to the cell then the cell be allow to grow utilize the label feed for stationary metabolic flux analysis the cell must reach a steady state the isotope enter and leave the cell remain constant with time or a state steady state be reach for a give period of time the isotope pattern of the output metabolite be determine the output isotope pattern provide valuable information which can be use to find the magnitude of flux rate of conversion from reactant to product through each reaction the figure demonstrate the ability to use different label to determine the flux through a certain reaction assume the original metabolite a three carbon compound have the ability to either split into a two carbon metabolite and one carbon metabolite in one reaction then recombine or remain a three carbon metabolite if the reaction be provide with two isotope of the metabolite in equal proportion one completely label blue circle commonly know a uniformly label and one completely unlabeled white circle the pathway down the left side of the diagram do not display any change in the metabolite while the right side show the split and recombination a show if the metabolite only take the pathway down the left side it remain in a ratio of uniformly label to unlabeled metabolite if the metabolite only take the right side new label pattern can occur all in equal proportion other proportion can occur depend on how much of the original metabolite follow the left side of the pathway versus the right side of the pathway here the proportion be show for a situation in which half of the metabolite take the left side and half the right but other proportion can occur these pattern of label atom and unlabeled atom in one compound represent isotopomers by measure the isotopomer distribution of the differently label metabolites the flux through each reaction can be determine mfa combine the data harvest from isotope label with the stoichiometry of each reaction constraint and an optimization procedure resolve a flux map the irreversible reaction provide the thermodynamic constraint need to find the flux a matrix be construct that contain the stoichiometry of the reaction the intracellular flux be estimate by use an iterative method in which simulate flux be plug into the stoichiometric model the simulated flux be display in a flux map which show the rate of reactant be convert to product for each reaction in most flux map the thicker the arrow the large the flux value of the reaction label measure any technique in measure the difference between isotopomers can be use the two primary method nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry m have be develop for measure mass isotopomers in stable isotope label proton nmr be the first technique use for experiment use this method each single protonated carbon position inside a particular metabolite pool can be observe separately from the other position this allow the percentage of isotopomers label at that specific position to be know the limit to proton nmr be that if there be n carbon atom in a metabolite there can only be at most n different positional enrichment value which be only a small fraction of the total isotopomer information although the use of proton nmr labeling be limit pure proton nmr experiment be much easy to evaluate than experiment with more isotopomer information in addition to proton nmr use nmr technique will allow a more detailed view of the distribution of the isotopomers a labeled carbon atom will produce different hyperfine splitting signal depend on the label state of it direct neighbor in the molecule a singlet peak emerge if the neighboring carbon atom be not label a doublet peak emerge if only one neighbor carbon atom be label the size of the doublet split depend on the functional group of the neighboring carbon atom if two neighbor carbon atom be label a doublet of doublet may degenerate into a triplet if the doublet splittings be equal the drawback to use nmr technique for metabolic flux analysis purpose be that it be different from other nmr application because it be a rather specialized discipline an nmr spectrometer may not be directly available for all research team the optimization of nmr measurement parameter and proper analysis of peak structure require a skilled nmr specialist certain metabolite also may require specialized measurement procedure to obtain additional isotopomer data in addition specially adapt software tool be need to determine the precise quantity of peak area as well a identify the decomposition of entangled singlet doublet and triplet peak a oppose to nuclear magnetic resonance mass spectrometry m be another method that be more applicable and sensitive to metabolic flux analysis experiment ms instrument be available in different variant different from nuclear magnetic resonance the m instrument work directly with hydrolysate in gas spectrometry the m be couple to a gas chromatograph to separate the compound of the hydrolysate the compound elute from the gc column be then ionize and simultaneously fragment the benefit in use be that not only be the mass isotopomers of the molecular ion measure but also the mass isotopomer spectrum of several fragment which significantly increase the measured information in liquid spectrometry the gc be replace with a liquid chromatograph the main difference be that chemical derivatization be not necessary application of to mfa however be rare in each case m instrument divide a particular isotopomer distribution by it molecular weight all isotopomers of a particular metabolite that contain the same number of labeled carbon atom be collect in one peak signal because every isotopomer contribute to exactly one peak in the m spectrum the percentage value can then be calculate for each peak yield the mass isotopomer fraction for a metabolite with n carbon atom measurement be produce after normalization exactly n informative mass isotopomer quantity remain the drawback to use m technique be that for gas chromatography the sample must be prepare by chemical derivatization in order to obtain molecule with charge there be numerous compound use to derivatize sample n dimethyl acetal dmfdma and mtbstfa be two example of compound that have be use to derivatize amino acid in addition strong isotope effect observe affect the retention time of differently label isotopomers in the gc column overloading of the gc column also must be prevent lastly the natural abundance of other atom than carbon also lead to a disturbance in the mass isotopomer spectrum for example each oxygen atom in the molecule might also be present a a isotope and a a isotope a more significant impact of the natural abundance of isotope be the effect of silicon with a natural abundance of the isotope and si be use in derivatizing agent for m technique radioisotopic labeling be a technique for track the passage of a sample of substance through a system the substance be label by include radionuclides in it chemical composition when these decay their presence can be determine by detect the radiation emit by them radioisotopic labeling be a special case of isotopic label for these purpose a particularly useful type of radioactive decay be positron emission when a positron collide with an electron it release two photon travel in diametrically opposite direction if the positron be produce within a solid object it be likely to do this before travel more than a millimeter if both of these photon can be detect the location of the decay event can be determine very precisely strictly speak radioisotopic label include only case where radioactivity be artificially introduce by experimenter but some natural phenomenon allow similar analysis to be perform in particular radiometric date use a closely related principle in proteomics the study of the full set of protein express by a genome identifying disease biomarkers can involve the usage of stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture silac that provide isotopic label form of amino acid use to estimate protein level in protein recombinant manipulate protein be produce in large quantity and isotope labeling be a tool to test for relevant proteins the method use to be about selectively enrich nucleus with or or deplete from them the recombinant would be express in with medium contain chloride a a source of nitrogen the result labeled protein be then purify by immobilized metal affinity and their percentage estimate in order to increase the yield of labeled protein and cut down the cost of isotope label medium an alternative procedure primarily increase the cell mass use unlabeled medium before introduce it in a minimal amount of labeled medium another application of isotope labeling would be in measure dna synthesis that be cell proliferation in vitro us label to compare pattern of synthesis or sequence in cell isotopic tracer be use to examine process in natural system especially terrestrial and aquatic environment in soil science tracer be use extensively to study nitrogen cycle whereas and stable and radioisotope of carbon respectively be use for study turnover of organic compound and fixation of by autotroph for example marsh et al use dual label and urea to demonstrate utilization of the compound by ammonia oxidizer a both an energy source ammonia oxidation and carbon source chemoautotrophic carbon fixation tracer be also use extensively in oceanography to study a wide array of process the isotope use be typically naturally occur with source and rate of formation and decay however anthropogenic isotope may also be use with great success the researcher measure the isotopic ratio at different location and time to infer information about the physical process of the ocean the ocean be an extensive network of particle transport thorium isotope can help researcher decipher the vertical and horizontal movement of matter have a constant production rate in the ocean and a of day this naturally occur isotope have be show to vary linearly with depth therefore any change in this linear pattern can be attribute to the transport of on particle for example low isotopic ratio in surface water with very high value a few meter down would indicate a vertical flux in the downward direction furthermore the thorium isotope may be trace within a specific depth to decipher the lateral transport of particle circulation within local system such a bay estuary and groundwater may be examine with radium isotope have a of day and can occur naturally at specific location in river and groundwater source the isotopic ratio of radium will then decrease a the water from the source river enter a bay or estuary by measure the amount of at a number of different location a circulation pattern can be decipher this same exact process can also be use to study the movement and discharge of groundwater various isotope of lead can be use to study circulation on a global scale different oceans the atlantic pacific indian etc have different isotopic signatures this result from difference in isotopic ratio of sediment and rock within the different ocean because the different isotope of lead have of year there be not enough time for the isotopic ratio to be homogenize throughout the whole ocean therefore precise analysis of pb isotopic ratio can be use to study the circulation of the different ocean process and climate isotope with extremely long can be use to study year process such a tectonics and extreme climate change the isotopic ratio of strontium ma can be analyze within ice core to examine change over the earth lifetime difference in this ratio within the ice core would indicate significant alteration in the earth geochemistry relate to nuclear the aforementioned process can be measure use naturally occur isotope nevertheless anthropogenic isotope be also extremely useful for oceanographic measurement nuclear weapon test release a plethora of uncommon isotope into the world ocean and can be find dissolve in seawater while and be attach to particles the isotope dissolve in water be particularly useful in study global circulation for example difference in lateral isotopic ratio within an ocean can indicate strong water front or gyre conversely the isotope attach to particle can be use to study mass transport within water column for instance high level of be or pu can indicate downwelling when observe at great depth or upwelling when observe at the surface chemical synthesis exchange recombinant protein

in the physic of gauge theory fix also call a gauge denote a mathematical procedure for cop with redundant degree of freedom in field variable by definition a gauge theory represent each physically distinct configuration of the system a an equivalence class of detailed local field configuration any two detailed configuration in the same equivalence class be relate by a gauge transformation equivalent to a shear along unphysical ax in configuration space most of the quantitative physical prediction of a gauge theory can only be obtain under a coherent prescription for suppress or ignore these unphysical degree of freedom although the unphysical ax in the space of detailed configuration be a fundamental property of the physical model there be no special set of direction perpendicular to them hence there be an enormous amount of freedom involve in take a cross section represent each physical configuration by a particular detailed configuration or even a weighted distribution of them judicious gauge fixing can simplify calculation immensely but become progressively hard a the physical model become more realistic it application to quantum field theory be fraught with complication relate to renormalization especially when the computation be continue to high order historically the search for logically consistent and computationally tractable gauge fixing procedure and effort to demonstrate their equivalence in the face of a bewildering variety of technical difficulty have be a major driver of mathematical physic from the late nineteenth century to the present the archetypical gauge theory be the formulation of continuum electrodynamics in term of an electromagnetic which be present here in asymmetric heaviside notation the electric field and magnetic field of maxwell equation contain only physical degree of freedom in the sense that every mathematical degree of freedom in an electromagnetic field configuration have a separately measurable effect on the motion of test charge in the vicinity these field strength variable can be express in term of the electric scalar potential and the magnetic vector potential through the relation if the transformation be make then remain unchanged since however this transformation change accord to if another change be make then also remain the same hence the and field be unchanged if one take any function and simultaneously transforms and φ via the transformation and a particular choice of the scalar and vector potential be a more precisely potential and a scalar function ψ use to change the gauge be call a function the existence of arbitrary number of gauge function correspond to the u freedom of this theory gauge fixing can be do in many way some of which we exhibit below although classical electromagnetism be now often speak of a a gauge theory it be not originally conceive in these term the motion of a classical point charge be affect only by the electric and magnetic field strength at that point and the potential can be treat a a mere mathematical device for simplify some proof and calculation not until the advent of quantum field theory could it be say that the potential themselves be part of the physical configuration of a system the early consequence to be accurately predict and experimentally verify be the effect which have no classical counterpart nevertheless gauge freedom be still true in these theory for example the effect depend on a line integral of around a closed loop and this integral be not change by gauge fixing in gauge theory such a theory and general relativity be a rather more complicated topic for detail see gribov ambiguity ghost and frame bundle gauge fixing of a twisted cylinder note the line be on the surface of the cylinder not inside it by look at a cylindrical rod can one tell whether it be twist if the rod be perfectly cylindrical then the circular symmetry of the cross section make it impossible to tell whether or not it be twist however if there be a straight line draw along the length of the rod then one could easily say whether or not there be a twist by look at the state of the line draw a line be fix draw the line spoil the gauge symmetry the circular symmetry u of the cross section at each point of the rod the line be the equivalent of a function it need not be straight almost any line be a valid gauge fixing there be a large freedom to tell whether the rod be twist you need to first know the gauge physical quantity such a the energy of the torsion do not depend on the gauge be invariant the gauge also know a the transverse gauge be use in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physic and be define by the gauge condition more precisely gauge fix condition it be particularly useful for calculation in quantum mechanic in which the vector potential be quantize but the coulomb interaction be not the coulomb gauge have a number of property the lorenz gauge be give in si unit by and in gaussian unit by this may be rewrite a where be the electromagnetic the use the metric signature it be unique among the constraint gauge in retain manifest lorentz invariance note however that this gauge be originally name after the danish physicist ludvig lorenz and not after hendrik lorentz it be often misspell lorentz gauge neither be the first to use it in calculation it be introduce in by george f fitzgerald the lorenz gauge lead to the follow inhomogeneous wave equation for the potential it can be see from these equation that in the absence of current and charge the solution be potential which propagate at the speed of light the lorenz gauge be incomplete in some sense there remain a subspace of gauge transformation which can also preserve the constraint these remain degree of freedom correspond to gauge function which satisfy the wave equation these remain gauge degree of freedom propagate at the speed of light to obtain a fully fix gauge one must add boundary condition along the light cone of the experimental region maxwell equation in the lorenz gauge simplify to where be the two solution of these equation for the same current configuration differ by a solution of the vacuum wave equation in this form it be clear that the component of the potential separately satisfy the equation and hence that the lorenz gauge condition allow transversely longitudinally and polarized wave in the the transverse polarization correspond to classical radiation transversely polarized wave in the field strength to suppress the unphysical longitudinal and polarization state which be not observe in experiment at classical distance scale one must also employ auxiliary constraint know a ward identity classically these identity be equivalent to the continuity equation many of the difference between classical and quantum electrodynamics can be account for by the role that the longitudinal and polarization play in interaction between charge particle at microscopic distance the r ξ gauge be a generalization of the lorenz gauge applicable to theory express in term of an action principle with lagrangian density instead of fix the gauge by constrain the gauge field a priori via an auxiliary equation one add a gauge break term to the physical gauge invariant lagrangian the choice of the parameter ξ determine the choice of gauge the gauge be classically equivalent to lorenz gauge it be obtain in the limit ξ but postpones take that limit until after the theory have be quantize it improve the rigor of certain existence and equivalence proof most quantum field theory computation be simple in the hooft gauge in which a few be more tractable in other r ξ gauge such a the gauge an equivalent formulation of r ξ gauge use an auxiliary field a scalar field b with no independent dynamic the auxiliary field sometimes call a field can be eliminate by complete the square to obtain the previous form from a mathematical perspective the auxiliary field be a variety of goldstone boson and it use have advantage when identify the asymptotic state of the theory and especially when generalize beyond qed historically the use of r ξ gauge be a significant technical advance in extend quantum electrodynamics computation beyond order in addition to retain manifest lorentz invariance the rξ prescription break the symmetry under local gauge transformation while preserve the ratio of functional measure of any two physically distinct gauge configuration this permit a change of variable in which infinitesimal perturbation along physical direction in configuration space be entirely uncoupled from those along unphysical direction allow the latter to be absorb into the physically meaningless normalization of the functional integral when ξ be finite each physical configuration orbit of the group of gauge transformation be represent not by a single solution of a constraint equation but by a gaussian distribution center on the extremum of the gauge break term in term of the feynman rule of the theory this appear a a contribution to the photon propagator for internal line from virtual photon of unphysical polarization the photon propagator which be the multiplicative factor correspond to an internal photon in the feynman diagram expansion of a qed calculation contain a factor g μν corresponding to the minkowski metric an expansion of this factor a a sum over photon polarization involve term contain all four possible polarization transversely polarize radiation can be express mathematically a a sum over either a linearly or circularly polarize basis similarly one can combine the longitudinal and gauge polarization to obtain forward and backward polarization these be a form of coordinate in which the metric be an expansion of the g μν factor in term of circularly polarize spin and coordinate be call a spin sum spin sum can be very helpful both in simplify expression and in obtain a physical understanding of the experimental effect associate with different term in a theoretical calculation richard feynman use argument along approximately these line largely to justify calculation procedure that produce consistent finite high precision result for important observable parameter such a the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron although his argument sometimes lack mathematical rigor even by physicist standard and gloss over detail such a the derivation of identity of the quantum theory his calculation work and freeman dyson soon demonstrate that his method be substantially equivalent to those of julian schwinger and tomonaga with whom feynman share the nobel prize in physic forward and backward polarize radiation can be omit in the asymptotic state of a quantum field theory see identity for this reason and because their appearance in spin sum can be see a a mere mathematical device in qed much like the electromagnetic in classical electrodynamics they be often speak of as unphysical but unlike the gauge fixing procedure above the rξ gauge generalize well to gauge group such a the su of qcd the coupling between physical and unphysical perturbation ax do not entirely disappear under the corresponding change of variable to obtain correct result one must account for the jacobian of the embedding of gauge freedom ax within the space of detailed configuration this lead to the explicit appearance of forward and backward polarize gauge boson in feynman diagram along with ghost which be even more unphysical in that they violate the theorem the relationship between these entity and the reason why they do not appear a particle in the quantum mechanical sense become more evident in the brst formalism of quantization in any gauge theory any abelian gauge be an incomplete gauge which fix the gauge freedom outside of the maximal abelian subgroup example be su gauge theory in d dimension the maximal abelian subgroup be a u subgroup if this be choose to be the one generate by the pauli matrix then the maximal abelian gauge be that which maximize the function where su gauge theory in d dimension the maximal abelian subgroup be a u subgroup if this be choose to be the one generate by the matrix and then the maximal abelian gauge be that which maximize the function where this apply regularly in high algebra of group in the algebra for example the clifford

choice it be name after hermann weyl it eliminate the ghost lack manifest lorentz invariance and require longitudinal photon and a constraint on state the gauge condition of the gauge also know a the

myoglobin blue with it ligand heme orange bound base on in biochemistry and pharmacology a be a substance that form a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose in bind the ligand be usually a molecule which produce a signal by bind to a site on a target protein the binding typically result in a change of conformational isomerism conformation of the target protein in bind study the ligand can be a small molecule ion or protein which bind to the dna double helix the relationship between ligand and binding partner be a function of charge hydrophobicity and molecular structure the instance of bind occurs over an infinitesimal range of time and space so the rate constant be usually a very small number binding occurs by intermolecular force such a ionic bond hydrogen bond and van der waals force the association or docking be actually reversible through dissociation measurably irreversible covalent bond between a ligand and target molecule be atypical in biological system in contrast to the definition of ligand in metalorganic and inorganic chemistry in biochemistry it be ambiguous whether the ligand generally bind at a metal site a be the case in hemoglobin in general the interpretation of ligand be contextual with regard to what sort of binding have be observe the etymology stem from ligare which mean bind ligand bind to a receptor protein alter the conformation by affect the shape orientation the conformation of a receptor protein compose the functional state ligand include substrate inhibitor activator signal lipid and neurotransmitter the rate of binding be call affinity and this measurement typify a tendency or strength of the effect bind affinity be actualize not only by interaction but also by solvent effect that can play a dominant steric role which drive bind in solution the solvent provide a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt and thus accept or reject each other a partner radioligands be radioisotope label compound use in vivo a tracer in pet study and for in vitro binding study the interaction of ligand with their binding site can be characterize in term of a binding affinity in general ligand bind result from great attractive force between the ligand and it receptor while ligand bind involves less attractive force in general binding result in a high occupancy of the receptor by it ligand than be the case for bind the residence time lifetime of the complex do not correlate binding of ligand to receptor be often physiologically important when some of the bind energy can be use to cause a conformational change in the receptor result in altered behavior for example of an associated ion channel or enzyme a ligand that can bind to and alter the function of the receptor that trigger a physiological

receptor can be characterize both in term of how much physiological response can be trigger that be the efficacy and in term of the concentration of the agonist that be require to produce the physiological response often measure a the concentration require to produce the response ligand bind implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand be adequate to maximally occupy a site and trigger a physiological response receptor affinity be measure by an inhibition constant or ki value the concentration require to occupy of the receptor ligand affinity be most often measure indirectly

through the cheng prusoff equation ligand affinity can also be measure directly a a dissociation constant kd use method such a fluorescence quench isothermal titration calorimetry or surface plasmon resonance bind high ki level implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand be require before the binding site be maximally occupy and the maximum physiological response to the ligand be achieve in the example show to the right two different ligand bind to the same receptor bind site only one of the agonist show can maximally stimulate the receptor and thus can be define a a full agonist an agonist that can only partially activate the physiological response be call a partial agonist in this example the concentration at which the full agonist red curve can activate the receptor be about x molar nm nanomolar two ligand with different receptor bind affinity bind affinity be most commonly determine use a radiolabeled ligand know a a tagged ligand competitive binding experiment involve bind competition between a tagged ligand and an untagged ligand base method which be often such a surface plasmon resonance interferometry and surface plasmon resonance can not only quantify the affinity from concentration base assay but also from the kinetics of association and dissociation and in the late case the conformational change induce upon bind also enable measurement in high saline dissociation buffer thanks to a unique optical setup microscale thermophoresis mst an method be develop this method allow the determination of the binding affinity without any limitation to the ligand molecular weight for the use of statistical mechanic in a quantitative study of the binding affinity see the comprehensive article on the configurational partition function drug potency and bind affinity bind affinity data alone do not determine the overall potency of a drug potency be a result of the complex interplay of both the binding affinity and the ligand efficacy ligand efficacy refers to the ability of the ligand to produce a biological response upon bind to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response this response may be a an agonist antagonist or inverse agonist depend on the physiological response produce and selective ligand have a tendency to bind to very limited kind of receptor whereas ligands bind to several type of receptor this play an important role in pharmacology where drug that be tend to have more adverse effect because they bind to several other receptor in addition to the one generate the desired effect for hydrophobic ligand in complex with a hydrophobic protein ion channel determine the affinity be complicate by hydrophobic interaction hydrophobic interaction can be overcome when the affinity of the ligand be high for example bind with high affinity to gate ion channel bivalent ligand consist of two molecule pharmacophores or ligand connect by an inert linker there be various kind of bivalent ligand and be often classify base on what the pharmacophores target homobivalent ligand target two of the same receptor type heterobivalent ligand target two different receptor type bitopic ligands target an orthosteric binding site and allosteric binding site on the same receptor in scientific research bivalent ligand have be use to study receptor dimer and to investigate their property this class of ligand be pioneer by philip portoghese and coworkers while study the opioid receptor system bivalent ligand be also report early on by micheal conn and coworkers for the hormone receptor since these early report there have be many bivalent ligand report for various g receptor gpcr system include cannabinoid serotonin oxytocin and melanocortin receptor system and for system and nach receptor bivalent ligand usually tend to be large than their monovalent counterpart and therefore not see lipinski rule of five many believe this limit their applicability in clinical setting in spite of these belief there have be many ligand that have report successful animal study give that some bivalent ligand can have many advantage compare to their monovalent counterpart such a tissue selectivity increase bind affinity and increased potency or efficacy bivalents may offer some clinical advantage as well ligands of protein can be characterize also by the number of protein chain they bind ligand μόνος

macromolecular docking be the computational modelling of the quaternary structure of complex form by two or more interacting biological macromolecule complex be the most commonly attempted target of such modelling follow by acid complex the ultimate goal of docking be the prediction of the structure of the macromolecular complex of interest a it would occur in a living organism dock itself only produce plausible candidate structure these candidate must be rank use method such a score function to identify structure that be most likely to occur in nature the term dock originate in the late with a more restricted meaning then dock meant refine a model of a complex structure by optimize the separation between the interactors but keep their relative orientation fix later the relative orientation of the interact partner in the modelling be allow to vary but the internal geometry of each of the partner be hold fix this type of modelling be sometimes refer to a rigid dock with further increase in computational power it become possible to model change in internal geometry of the interact partner that may occur when a complex be form this type of modelling be refer to a flexible dock the biological role of most protein a characterize by which other macromolecule they interact with be know at best incompletely even those protein that participate in a biological process the krebs cycle may have unexpected interaction partner or function which be unrelated to that process in case of know interaction other question arise genetic disease cystic fibrosis be know to be cause by misfolded or mutated protein and there be a desire to understand what if any anomalous interaction a give mutation can cause in the distant future protein may be design to perform biological function and a determination of the potential interaction of such protein will be essential for any give set of protein the following question may be of interest from the point of view of technology or natural history do these protein bind in vivo if they do bind what be the spatial configuration which they adopt in their bound state how strong or weak be their interaction if they do not bind can they be make to bind by induce a mutation docking be ultimately envisage to address all these issue furthermore since dock method can be base on purely physical principle even protein of unknown function or which have be study relatively little may be dock the only prerequisite be that their molecular structure have be either determine experimentally or can be estimate by a protein structure prediction technique acid interaction feature prominently in the living cell transcription factor which regulate gene expression and polymerase which catalyse replication be compose of protein and the genetic material they interact with be compose of nucleic acid model acid complex present some unique challenge a describe below in the complex modelling revolve around manually identify feature on the surface of the interactors and interpret the consequence for bind function and activity any computer programme be typically use at the end of the modelling process to discriminate between the relatively few configuration which remain after all the heuristic constraint have be impose the first use of computer be in a study on hemoglobin interaction in fibre this be follow in by work on the complex computer discriminate between good and bad model use a scoring function which reward large interface area and pair of molecule in contact but not occupy the same space the computer use a simplified representation of the interacting proteins with one interaction centre for each residue favorable electrostatic interaction include hydrogen bond be identify by hand in the early more structure of complex be determine and available computational power have increase substantially with the emergence of bioinformatics the focus move towards develop generalize technique which could be apply to an arbitrary set of complex at acceptable computational cost the new method be envisage to apply even in the absence of phylogenetic or experimental clue any specific prior knowledge could still be introduce at the stage of choose between the high ranking output model or be frame a input if the algorithm cater for it saw the publication of the correlation method an algorithm which use the fast fourier transform to give a vastly improve scalability for evaluate coarse shape complementarity on model this be extend in to cover coarse electrostatics in the result of the first blind trial be publish in which six research group attempt to predict the complexed structure of with inhibitor protein blip the exercise bring into focus the necessity of accommodate conformational change and the difficulty of discriminate between conformers it also serve a the prototype for the capri assessment series which debut in if the bond angle bond length and torsion angle of the component be not modify at any stage of complex generation it be know a rigid body dock a subject of speculation be whether or not dock be sufficiently good for most dock when substantial conformational change occur within the component at the time of complex formation docking be inadequate however score all possible conformational change be prohibitively expensive in computer time dock procedure which permit conformational change or flexible docking procedure must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational change for consideration successful dock require two criterion a set of configuration which reliably include at least one nearly correct one distinguish nearly correct configuration from the others for many interaction the binding site be know on one or more of the protein to be dock this be the case for antibody and for competitive inhibitor in other case a binding site may be strongly suggest by mutagenic or phylogenetic evidence configuration where the protein interpenetrate severely may also be rule out a priori after make exclusion base on prior knowledge or stereochemical clash the remain space of possible complexed structure must be sample exhaustively evenly and with a sufficient coverage to guarantee a near hit each configuration must be score with a measure that be capable of rank a nearly correct structure above at least alternative this be a computationally intensive task and a variety of strategy have be develop reciprocal space method each of the protein may be represent a a simple cubic lattice then for the class of score which be discrete convolution configuration relate to each other by translation of one protein by an exact lattice vector can all be score almost simultaneously by apply the convolution theorem it be possible to construct reasonable if approximate scoring function represent both stereochemical and electrostatic fitness reciprocal space method have be use extensively for their ability to evaluate enormous number of configuration they lose their speed advantage if torsional change be introduce another drawback be that it be impossible to make efficient use of prior knowledge the question also remain whether convolution be too limited a class of score function to identify the best complex reliably monte carlo method in monte carlo an initial configuration be refine by take random step which be accept or reject base on their induced improvement in score see the metropolis criterion until a certain number of step have be try the assumption be that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configuration only one of which need to be consider initial configuration may be sample coarsely and much computation time can be save because of the difficulty of find a scoring function which be both highly discriminate for the correct configuration and also converge to the correct configuration from a distance the use of two level of refinement with different score function have be propose torsion can be introduce naturally to monte carlo a an additional property of each random move monte carlo method be not guarantee to search exhaustively so that the best configuration may be miss even use a scoring function which would in theory identify it how severe a problem this be for dock have not be firmly establish score function to find a score which form a consistent basis for select the best configuration study be carry out on a standard benchmark see below of interaction case score function be assess on the rank they assign to the best structure ideally the best structure should be rank and on their coverage the proportion of the benchmark case for which they achieve an acceptable result type of score study include score base on residue contact complementarity of molecular surface stereochemistry energy estimate use parameter from molecular mechanic force field such a charmm or amber desirability of the interacting region coefficient base cue it be usual to create hybrid score by combine one or more category above in a weighted sum whose weight be optimize on case from the benchmark to avoid bias the benchmark case use to optimize the weight must not overlap with the case use to make the final test of the score the ultimate goal in docking be to select the ideal rank solution accord to a score scheme that would also give an insight into the affinity of the complex such a development would drive in silico protein engineering drug design annotation of which proteins bind or not annotation of interactome several score function have be propose for bind affinity free energy prediction however the correlation between experimentally determine binding affinity and the prediction of nine commonly use score function have be find to be nearly orthogonal it be also observe that some component of the score algorithm may display good correlation to the experimental binding energy than the full score suggest that a significantly good performance might be obtain by combine the appropriate contribution from different score algorithms experimental method for the determination of bind affinity be surface plasmon resonance spr förster resonance energy transfer technique isothermal titration calorimetry itc microscale thermophoresis mst or spectroscopic measurement and other fluorescence technique textual information from scientific article can provide useful cue for score benchmark a benchmark of interaction with know complexed structure have be develop for test dock method the set be choose to cover a wide range of interaction type and to avoid repeated feature such a the profile of interactors structural family accord to the scop database benchmark element be classify into three level of difficulty the most difficult contain the large change in backbone conformation the dock benchmark contains example of and homomultimeric complex the late version of dock benchmark consist of complex a docking benchmark consist of test case a docking benchmark be curated a a dataset of test case with complex solve by crystallography only as well a an extended dataset

point over time more formally a flow be a group action of the real number on a set the idea of a vector flow that be the flow determine by a vector field occur in the area of differential topology riemannian geometry and lie group specific example of vector flow include the geodesic flow the hamiltonian flow the ricci flow the mean curvature flow and anosov flow flow may also be define for system of random variable and stochastic process and occur in the study of ergodic dynamical system the most celebrated of these be perhaps the bernoulli flow a on a set be a group action of the additive group of real number on more explicitly a flow be a mapping such that for all and all real number and it be customary to write instead of so that the equation above can be express a identity function and group law then for all the mapping be a bijection with inverse this follow from the above definition and the real parameter may be take a a generalized functional power a in function iteration flow be usually require to be compatible with structure furnish on the set in particular if be equip with a topology then be usually require to be continuous if be equip with a

might also consider flow which be define only in some subset call the domain of this be often the case with the flow of vector field alternative notation it be very common in many field include engineering physic and the study of differential equation to use a notation that make the flow implicit thus be write for and one might say that the variable depends on the time and the initial condition example be give below in the case of a flow of a vector field on a smooth manifold the flow be often denote in such a way that it generator be make explicit for example give in the set be call the orbit of under informally it may be regard a the trajectory of a particle that be initially position at if the flow be generate by a vector field then it orbit be the image of it integral curve autonomous system of ordinary differential equation let be a vector field and the solution of the initial value problem then be the of the vector field f it be a local flow provide that the

differential equation in the case of vector field one denote where be the solution of then be the flow of f it be not a flow by the definition above but it can easily be see a one by rearrange it argument namely the mapping indeed satisfy the group law for the last variable one can see flow of vector field a special case of one by the following trick define then y t be the solution of the initial value problem if and only if be the solution of the original initial value problem furthermore then the mapping be exactly the flow of the vector field g flow of vector field on manifold the flow of and vector field be define on smooth manifold exactly a they be define on the euclidean space and their local behavior be the same however the global topological structure of a smooth manifold

in mathematics the bracket be an extension of the lie bracket of vector field to differential form on a differentiable manifold it be useful in the study of connection notably the ehresmann connection as well a in the more general study of projection in the tangent bundle it be introduce by alfred frölicher and albert nijenhuis and be relate to the work of schouten it be relate to but not the same a the bracket and the bracket let m be the sheaf of exterior algebra of differential form on a smooth manifold m this be a graded algebra in which form be grade by degree a graded derivation of degree ℓ be a mapping which be linear with respect to constant and satisfies thus in particular the interior product with a vector define a graded derivation of degree ℓ whereas the exterior derivative be a graded derivation of degree ℓ the vector space of all derivation of degree ℓ be denote by m the direct sum of these space be a graded vector space whose homogeneous component consist of all graded derivation of a give degree it be denote this form a graded lie superalgebra under the anticommutator of derivation define on homogeneous derivation d and d of degree d and d respectively by any differential form k in ω k m t m with value in the tangent bundle of m defines a graded derivation of degree k denote by i and call the insertion operator for ω ωℓ m the derivative along k ωk m t m be define by where d be the exterior derivative and i k be the insertion operator the bracket be define to be the unique differential form such that hence if k so that k m t m be a vector field the usual homotopy formula for the lie derivative be recover if k ℓ so that k l m t m one have for any vector field x and y if k and ℓ so that m t m be a vector field and l m t m one have for any vector field x an explicit formula for the bracket of and for form φ and ψ and vector field x and y be give by every derivation of m can be write a for unique element k and l of m t m the lie bracket of these derivation be give a follow derivation of the form form the lie superalgebra of all derivation commute with d the bracket be give by where the bracket on the right be the bracket in particular the bracket define a graded lie algebra structure on which extend the lie bracket of vector field derivation of the form form the lie superalgebra of all derivation vanish on function m the bracket be give by where the bracket on the right be the bracket bracket of derivation of different type be give by for k in ωk m t m l in m t m the nijenhuis tensor of an almost complex structure j be the bracket of j with itself an almost complex structure be a complex structure if and only if the nijenhuis tensor be zero with the bracket it be possible to define the curvature and cocurvature of a which be a projection this generalize the concept of the curvature of a connection there be a common generalization of the bracket and the bracket for detail see the article on the bracket,Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket,Subfields of physics,Theoretical physics
the principle of reversibility in physic and chemistry be twofold first it state that the microscopic detail dynamic of particle and field be because the microscopic equation of motion be symmetric with respect to inversion in time second it relate to the statistical description of the kinetics of macroscopic or mesoscopic system a an ensemble of elementary process collision elementary transition or reaction for these process the consequence of the microscopic be correspond to every individual process there be a reverse process and in a state of equilibrium the average rate of every process be equal to the average rate of it reverse process the idea of microscopic reversibility be bear together with physical kinetics in ludwig boltzmann represent kinetics of gas a statistical ensemble of elementary collision equation of mechanic be reversible in time hence the reverse collision obey the same law this reversibility of collision be the first example of microreversibility accord to boltzmann this microreversibility imply the principle of detailed balance for collision at the equilibrium ensemble each collision be equilibrate by it reverse collision these idea of boltzmann be analyze in detail and generalize by richard tolman in chemistry va hoff come up with the idea that equilibrium have dynamical nature and be a result of the balance between the forward and backward reaction rate he do not study reaction mechanism with many elementary reaction and could not formulate the principle of detailed balance for complex reaction in rudolf wegscheider introduce the principle of detailed balance for complex chemical reaction he find that for a complex reaction the principle of detailed balance implies important and relation between reaction rate constant for different reaction in particular he demonstrate that the irreversible cycle of reaction be impossible and for the reversible cycle the product of constant of the forward reaction in the clockwise direction be equal to the product of constant of the reverse reaction in the anticlockwise direction lars onsager use these relation in his work without direct citation but with the following remark here however the chemist be accustom to impose a very interesting additional restriction namely when the equilibrium be reach each individual reaction must balance itself they require that the transition must take place just as frequently a the reverse transition etc the quantum theory of emission and absorption develop by albert einstein give an example of application of the microreversibility and detailed balance to development of a new branch of kinetic theory sometimes the principle of detailed balance be formulate in the narrow sense for chemical reaction only but in the history of physic it have the broad use it be invent for collision use for emission and absorption of quantum for transport process and for many other phenomenon in it modern form the principle of microreversibility be publish by lewis in the classical textbook full theory and many example of application be present the newton and the schrödinger equation in the absence of the macroscopic magnetic field and in the inertial frame of reference be if x t be a solution then x be also a solution here x be the vector of all dynamic variable include all the coordinate of particle for the newton equation and the wave function in the configuration space for the schrödinger equation there be two source of the violation of this rule first if dynamic depend on a pseudovector like the magnetic field or the rotation angular speed in the rotating frame then the do not hold second in microphysics of weak interaction the may be violate and only the combine cpt symmetry hold in physic and chemistry there be two main macroscopic consequence of the of microscopic dynamic the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relation the statistical description of the macroscopic process a an ensemble of the elementary indivisible event collision be invent by boltzmann and formalise in the boltzmann equation he discover that the of the newtonian dynamic lead to the detailed balance for collision in equilibrium collision be equilibrate by their reverse collision this principle allow boltzmann to deduce simple and nice formula for entropy production and prove his famous in this way microscopic reversibility be use to prove macroscopic irreversibility and convergence of ensemble of molecule to their thermodynamic equilibrium another macroscopic consequence of microscopic reversibility be the symmetry of kinetic coefficient the reciprocal relation the reciprocal relation be discover in the century by thomson and helmholtz for some phenomenon but the general theory be propose by lars onsager in he find also the connection between the reciprocal relation and detailed balance for the equation of the law of mass action the reciprocal relation appear in the linear approximation near equilibrium a a consequence of the detailed balance condition accord to the reciprocal relation the damped oscillation in homogeneous close system near thermodynamic equilibrium be impossible because the spectrum of symmetric operator be real therefore the relaxation to equilibrium in such a system be monotone if it be sufficiently close to the equilibrium detail

small nuclear rna be a class of small rna molecule that be find within the splicing speckle and cajal body of the cell nucleus in eukaryotic cell the length of an average snrna be approximately nucleotide they be transcribe by either rna polymerase ii or rna polymerase iii their primary function be in the processing of rna hnrna in the nucleus they have also be show to aid in the regulation of transcription factor rna or rna polymerase ii rna and maintain the telomere snrna be always associate with a set of specific protein and the complex be refer to a small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snrnp often pronounced snurps each snrnp particle be compose of a snrna component and several protein include sm proteins a family of nuclear proteins the most common human snrna component of these complex be know respectively a spliceosomal rna spliceosomal rna spliceosomal rna spliceosomal rna and spliceosomal rna their nomenclature derives from their high uridine content snrnas be discover by accident during a gel electrophoresis experiment in an unexpected type of rna be find in the gel and investigate later analysis have show that these rna be high in uridylate and be establish in the nucleus snrnas and small nucleolar rna snornas be not the same and be not a type of one another both be different and be a class under small rna these be small rna molecule that play an essential role in rna biogenesis and guide chemical modification of ribosomal rna rrnas and other rna gene trna and snrnas they be locate in the nucleolus and the cajal body of eukaryotic cell the major site of rna synthesis where they be call scarnas small cajal rnas snrna be often divide into two class base upon both common sequence feature as well a associate protein factor such a the lsm proteins the first class know a snrna be more widely study and consists of and snrna be transcribe by rna polymerase ii the be transcribed and receive the usual cap in the nucleus they be then export to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore for further processing in the cytoplasm the snrna receive trim to form a structure as well a hypermethylation of the cap to form trimethylguanosine the stem structure be necessary for recognition by the survival of motor neuron smn protein this complex assemble the snrna into stable ribonucleoproteins rnps the modified cap be then require to import the snrnp back into the nucleus all of these snrna with the exception of form the core of the spliceosome splicing or the removal of intron be a major aspect of modification and take place only in the nucleus of eukaryote snrna have be find to function in histone process the second class know a snrna consist of and snrnas be transcribe by rna polymerase iii and never leave the nucleus in contrast to snrna snrnas contain a cap and a terminating in a stretch of uridines that form the binding site for a distinct heteroheptameric ring of lsm protein a comparison between major and minor splicing mechanism spliceosomes catalyse splice an integral step in eukaryotic precursor messenger rna maturation a splice mistake in even a single nucleotide can be devastate to the cell and a reliable repeatable method of rna processing be necessary to ensure cell survival the spliceosome be a large complex that consist of five small nuclear rna and and over proteins the snrnas along with their associated protein form ribonucleoprotein complex snrnps which bind to specific sequence on the substrate this intricate process result in two sequential transesterification reaction these reaction will produce a free lariat intron and ligate two exon to form a mature mrna there be two separate class of spliceosomes the major class which be far more abundant in eukaryotic cell splice primarily introns the initial step of splicing be the bonding of the snrnp and it associated protein to the splice end to the hnrna this create the commitment complex which will constrain the hnrna to the splice pathway then snrnp be recruit to the spliceosome binding site and form complex a after which the complex bind to complex a to form the structure know a complex b after rearrangement complex c be form and the spliceosome be active for catalysis in the catalytically active spliceosome and snrnas fold to form a conserved structure call the catalytic triplex this structure coordinate two magnesium ion that form the active site of the spliceosome this be an example of rna catalysis in addition to this main spliceosome complex there exist a much less common minor spliceosome this complex comprises and snrnps these snrnps be functional analog of the snrnps use in the major spliceosome the minor spliceosome splice introns the two type of intron mainly differ in their splicing site intron have and splice site while intron have at their and end the minor spliceosome carry out it function through a different pathway from the major spliceosome predict secondary structure and sequence conservation of snrna snrnp be the initiator of spliceosomal activity in the cell by base pairing with the splice site of the in the major spliceosome experimental data have show that the snrnp be present in equal stoichiometry with and snrnp however snrnp abundance in human cell be far great than that of the other snrnps through snrna gene knockdown in hela cell study have show the snrna hold great importance for cellular function when snrna gene be knock out genomic microarrays show an increase accumulation of unspliced in addition the knockout be show to cause premature cleavage and polyadenylation primarily in intron locate near the beginning of the transcript when other uridine base snrnas be knock out this effect be not see thus base pairing be show to protect from polyadenylation as well a premature cleavage this special protection may explain the overabundance of snrna in the cell through the study of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snrnps and small nucleolar sno rnps we have be able to good understand many important disease spinal muscular atrophy mutation in the survival motor gene result in the degeneration of spinal motor neuron and severe muscle waste the smn protein assemble snrnps and probably also snornps and other rnps spinal muscular atrophy affect up to in people and be the second leading cause of neuromuscular disease after duchenne muscular dystrophy dyskeratosis congenita mutation in the assembled snrnps be also find to be a cause of dyskeratosis congenita a rare syndrome that present by abnormal change in the skin nail and mucous membrane some ultimate effect of this disease include failure as well a cancer this syndrome have be show to arise from mutation in multiple gene include dyskerin telomerase rna and telomerase reverse transcriptase syndrome this syndrome affect as many a in people and have a presentation of extreme hunger cognitive and behavioural problem poor muscle tone and short stature the syndrome have be link to the deletion of a region of paternal chromosome that be not express on the maternal chromosome this region include a snrna that target the receptor mrna medulloblastoma the snrna be mutate in a subset of these brain tumor and lead to alter rna splice the mutation predominantly occur in adult tumor and be associate with poor prognosis in eukaryote snrnas contain a significant amount of modification and pseudouridylations these modification be associate with snorna activity which canonically modify rrnas but have be observe in modify other cellular rna target such a snrnas finally short poly a tailing can determine the fate of snrnas that be usually not poly a and thereby induce their rna decay this mechanism regulate the abundance of snrnas be in turn couple to a widespread change of

in physic principle be william rowan hamilton formulation of the principle of stationary action see that article for historical formulation it state that the dynamic of a physical system be determine by a variational problem for a functional base on a single function the lagrangian which contain all physical information concern the system and the force act on it the variational problem be equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the differential equation of motion of the physical system although formulate originally for classical mechanic hamilton principle also apply to classical field such a the electromagnetic and gravitational field and play an important role in quantum mechanic quantum field theory and criticality theory configuration space only some be show the path take by the system red have a stationary action δ s under small change in the configuration of the system δ hamilton principle state that the true evolution t of a system describe by n generalize coordinate q q q between two specified state t and t at two specified time t and t be a stationary point a point where the variation be zero of the action functional where be the lagrangian function for the system in other word any perturbation of the true evolution result in at most change in the action be a functional something that take a it input a function and return a single number a scalar in term of functional analysis hamilton principle state that the true evolution of a physical system be a solution of the functional equation that be the system take a path in configuration space for which the action be stationary with fixed boundary condition at the beginning and the end of the path equation derive from the action require that the true trajectory t be a stationary point of the action functional be equivalent to a set of differential equation for t the equation which may be derive a follow let t represent the true evolution of the system between two specified state t and t at two specified time t and t and let t be a small perturbation that be zero at the endpoint of the trajectory to first order in the perturbation t the change in the action functional would be where we have expand the lagrangian l to first order in the perturbation t apply integration by part to the last term result in the boundary condition cause the first term to vanish hamilton principle require that this change be zero for all possible perturbation t the true path be a stationary point of the action functional either a minimum maximum or saddle point this requirement can be satisfy if and only if these equation be call the equation for the variational problem momentum and constant of the momentum pk for a generalized coordinate qk be define by the equation an important special case of the equation occur when l do not contain a generalized coordinate qk explicitly that be the conjugate momentum be a constant of the motion in such case the coordinate qk be call a coordinate for example if we use polar coordinate t r θ to describe the planar motion of a particle and if l do not depend on θ the conjugate momentum be the conserved angular momentum free particle in polar trivial example help to appreciate the use of the action principle via the equation a free particle mass m and velocity v in euclidean space move in a straight line use the equation this can be show in polar coordinate a follow in the absence of a potential the lagrangian be simply equal to the kinetic energy in orthonormal x coordinate where the dot represent differentiation with respect to the curve parameter usually the time t therefore upon application of the equation and likewise for y thus the formulation can be use to derive newton law in polar coordinate r φ the kinetic energy and hence the lagrangian become the radial r and φ component of the equation become respectively the solution of these two equation be give by for a set of constant a b c d determine by initial condition thus indeed the solution be a straight line give in polar coordinate a be the velocity c be the distance of the close approach to the origin and d be the angle of motion hamilton principle be an important variational principle in elastodynamics a oppose to a system compose of rigid body deformable body have an infinite number of degree of freedom and occupy continuous region of space consequently the state of the system be describe by use continuous function of space and time the extended hamilton principle for such body be give by where t be the kinetic energy u be the elastic energy we be the work do by external load on the body and t t the initial and final time if the system be conservative the work do by external force may be derive from a scalar potential v in this case this be call hamilton principle and it be invariant under coordinate transformation hamilton principle and maupertuis principle be occasionally confuse and both have be call incorrectly the principle of least action they differ in three important way their definition of the action maupertuis principle use an integral over the generalized coordinate know a the action or reduce action where p p pn be the conjugate momentum define above by contrast hamilton principle use the integral of the lagrangian over time the solution that they determine hamilton principle determine the trajectory t a a function of time whereas maupertuis principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinate for example maupertuis principle determine the shape of the ellipse on which a particle move under the influence of an central force such a gravity but do not describe per se how the particle move along that trajectory however this time parameterization may be determine from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculation use the conservation of energy by contrast hamilton principle directly specify the motion along the ellipse a a function of time and the constraint on the variation maupertuis principle require that the two endpoint state q and q be give and that energy be conserve along every trajectory same energy for each trajectory this force the endpoint time to be vary a well by contrast hamilton principle do not require the conservation of energy but do require that the endpoint time t and t be specify as well a the endpoint state q and q field the principle can be extend to obtain the equation of motion for field such a the electromagnetic field or gravity the einstein equation utilize the action a constrain by a variational principle the path of a body in a gravitational field free fall in space time a geodesic can be find use the action principle mechanic and quantum field in quantum mechanic the system do not follow a single path whose action be stationary but the behavior of the system depend on all imaginable path and the value of their action the action correspond to the various path be use to calculate the path integral that give the probability amplitude of the various outcome although equivalent in classical mechanic with newton law the principle be well suit for generalization and play an important role in modern physic indeed this principle be one of the great generalization in physical science in particular it be fully appreciate and best understood within quantum mechanic richard feynman path

in the history of ismb it be the first one where the balance between europe and the state become an important part of the conference it be here that we establish the rule and the way and the spirit of collaboration between the american and the european the success of the joint conference pave the way for future european ismb meeting to be hold jointly with eccb by the end of iscb be in financial difficulty two conference ismb in brisbane and ismb in fortaleza have drastically reduce number of participant due to their location with a corresponding reduction in income to allow more delegate to attend it be decide to limit conference location to north america and europe in january ismb and eccb agree to hold joint conference in europe every other year begin with ismb would be hold in north america in the year between joint meeting this pattern have be confirm to continue until at least hold in vienna austria mark the first conference for which iscb take full responsibility for organise vienna become the first city to host ismb twice with this visit be an experiment intend to reduce the increase effort require to find suitable conference venue although the return to vienna be only deem partially successful due to price increase boston which host ismb and be predict to become a site which ismb can periodically return to ismb celebrate it meeting with ismb hold in long beach california this event attract around delegate submit scientific paper richard lathrop and lawrence hunter present a special keynote presentation look back at previous ismb meeting and attempt to

in the mathematical field of differential topology the bracket of vector field also know a the bracket or the of vector field be an operator that assign to any two vector field x and y on a smooth manifold m a third vector field denote conceptually the lie bracket be the derivative of y along the flow generate by x and be sometimes denoted lie derivative of y along x this generalize to the lie derivative of any tensor field along the flow generate by x the lie bracket be an operation and turn the set of all smooth vector field on the manifold m into an lie algebra the lie bracket play an important role in differential geometry and differential topology for instance in the frobenius integrability theorem and be also fundamental in the geometric theory of nonlinear control system there be three conceptually different but equivalent approach to define the lie bracket field a each smooth vector field x on a manifold m may be regard a a differential operator act on smooth function c m indeed each smooth vector field x become a derivation on c m when we define x f to be a function whose value at a point p be the directional derivative of f at p in the direction x p furthermore any derivation on c m arises from a unique smooth vector field x in general the commutator of any two derivation and be again a derivation where denote composition of operator this can be use to define the lie bracket a the vector field correspond to the commutator derivation and let be the flow associate with the vector field x and let d denote the tangent map derivative operator then the lie bracket of x and y at the point can be define a the lie derivative this also measure the failure of the flow in the successive direction to return to the point x though the above definition of lie bracket be intrinsic independent of the choice of coordinate on the manifold m in practice one often want to compute the bracket in term of a specific coordinate system we write for the associated local basis of the tangent bundle so that general vector field can be write and for smooth function then the lie bracket can be compute a if m be an open subset of n then the vector field x and y can be write a smooth map of the form and and the lie bracket be give by where and be jacobian matrix multiply the column vector x and y the lie bracket of vector field equip the real vector space of all vector field on m smooth section of the tangent bundle with the structure of a lie algebra which mean be a map with identity an immediate consequence of the second property be that for any furthermore there be a product rule for lie bracket give a smooth function f on m and a vector field y on m we get a new vector field fy by multiply the vector yx by the scalar f x at each point then where we multiply the scalar function x f with the vector field y and the scalar function f with the vector field this turn the vector field with the lie bracket into a lie algebroid vanishing of the lie bracket of x and y mean that follow the flow in these direction define a surface embed in m with x and y a coordinate vector field theorem iff the flow of x and y commute locally mean for all and sufficiently small s t this be a special case of the frobenius integrability theorem for a lie group g the corresponding lie algebra be the tangent space at the identity which can be identify with the vector space of left invariant vector field on g the lie bracket of two leave invariant vector field be also leave invariant which define the bracket operation for a matrix lie group whose element be matrix each tangent space can be represent a matrix where mean matrix multiplication and i be the identity matrix the invariant vector field correspond to be give by and a computation show the lie bracket on corresponds to the usual commutator of matrix the bracket be essential to prove local controllability stlc for driftless affine control system a mention above the lie derivative can be see a a generalization of the lie bracket another generalization of the lie bracket to differential form be the bracket extensive discussion of lie bracket and the general theory of lie derivative for generalization to infinite dimension,Lie bracket of vector fields,Subfields of physics,Theoretical physics
symmetry element of formaldehyde be a rotation axis σv and σv be two reflection plane molecular symmetry in chemistry describe the symmetry present in molecule and the classification of molecule accord to their symmetry molecular symmetry be a fundamental concept in chemistry a it can be use to predict or explain many of a molecule chemical property such a it dipole moment and it allow spectroscopic transition many university level textbook on physical chemistry quantum chemistry and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to symmetry the predominant framework for the study of molecular symmetry be group theory symmetry be useful in the study of molecular orbitals with application such a the hückel method ligand field theory and the rule another framework on a large scale be the use of crystal system to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk material many technique for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist include crystallography and various form of spectroscopy spectroscopic notation be base on symmetry consideration the study of symmetry in molecule make use of group theory example of the relationship between chirality and symmetry rotationalaxis c n improper rotational element s n s n mirror plane s σ inversion centre s i c c element the point group symmetry of a molecule can be describe by type of symmetry element axis an axis around which a rotation by result in a molecule indistinguishable from the original this be also call an n axis and abbreviate cn example be the axis in water and the axis in ammonia a molecule can have more than one symmetry axis the one with the high n be call the axis and by convention be align with the in a cartesian coordinate system of symmetry a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule be generate this be also call a mirror plane and abbreviate σ sigma greek s from the german meaning mirror water have two of them one in the plane of the molecule itself and one perpendicular to it a symmetry plane parallel with the principal axis be dub vertical σv and one perpendicular to it horizontal σh a third type of symmetry plane exist if a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisect the angle between two rotation ax perpendicular to the principal axis the plane be dub dihedral σd a symmetry plane can also be identify by it cartesian orientation xz or yz of symmetry or center abbreviate i a molecule have a center of symmetry when for any atom in the molecule an identical atom exist diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it in other word a molecule have a center of symmetry when the point x y z and correspond to identical object for example if there be an oxygen atom in some point x y z then there be an oxygen atom in the point there may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself example be xenon tetrafluoride where the inversion center be at the xe atom and benzene where the inversion center be at the center of the ring axis an axis around which a rotation by follow by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it leave the molecule unchanged also call an n rotation axis it be abbreviate sn example be present in tetrahedral silicon tetrafluoride with three ax and the staggered conformation of ethane with one axis an axis corresponds to a mirror plane σ and an axis be an inversion center i a molecule which have no sn axis for any value of n be a chiral molecule abbreviate to e from the german meaning unity this symmetry element simply consist of no change every molecule have this element while this element seem physically trivial it must be include in the list of symmetry element so that they form a mathematical group whose definition require inclusion of the identity element it be so call because it be analogous to multiply by one unity in other word e be a property that any object need to have regardless of it symmetry property operation with square planar geometry have axis and axes orthogonal to these five ax plus the mirror plane perpendicular to the axis define the symmetry group of the molecule the five symmetry element have associate with them five type of operation which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the start state they be sometimes distinguish from symmetry element by a caret or circumflex thus ĉn be the rotation of a molecule around an axis and ê be the identity operation a symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associate with it for example the axis of the square xenon tetrafluoride molecule be associate with two rotation in opposite direction and a rotation since be equivalent to ê to σ and to î all symmetry operation can be classify a either proper or improper rotation the symmetry operation of a molecule or other object form a group in mathematics a group be a set with a binary operation that satisfy the four property list below in a group the group element be the symmetry operation not the symmetry element and the binary combination consist of apply first one symmetry operation and then the other an example be the sequence of a rotation about the and a reflection in the denoted σ xy by convention the order of operation be from right to leave a symmetry group obey the define property of any group closure property for every pair of element x and y in g the product x y be also in g in symbol for every two element x y g x y be also in g this mean that the group be close so that combine two element produce no new element symmetry operation have this property because a sequence of two operation will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first so that the net effect on the molecule be still a symmetry operation associative property for every x and y and z in g both x y z and x y z result with the same element in g in symbol x y z x y z for every x y and z g existence of identity property there must be an element say e in g such that product any element of g with e make no change to the element in symbol x e e x x for every x g existence of inverse property for each element x in g there must be an element y in g such that product of x and y be the identity element e in symbol for each x g there be a y g such that x y y x e for every x g the order of a group be the number of element in the group for group of small order the group property can be easily verify by consider it composition table a table whose row and columns correspond to element of the group and whose entry correspond to their product group and chart for determine point group the successive application or composition of one or more symmetry operation of a molecule have an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule for example a rotation follow by a σv reflection be see to be a σv symmetry operation σv operation a follow by b to form c be write ba c moreover the set of all symmetry operation include this composition operation obeys all the property of a group give above so s be a group where s be the set of all symmetry operation of some molecule and denote the composition repeat application of symmetry operation this group be call the point group of that molecule because the set of symmetry operation leave at least one point fix though for some symmetry an entire axis or an entire plane remain fix in other word a point group be a group that summarize all symmetry operation that all molecule in that category have the symmetry of a crystal by contrast be describe by a space group of symmetry operation which include translation in space one can determine the symmetry operation of the point group for a particular molecule by consider the geometrical symmetry of it molecular model however when one use a point group the operation in it be not to be interpret in the same way instead the operation be interpret a rotate reflect the vibronic coordinate and these operation commute with the vibronic hamiltonian they be symmetry operation for that vibronic hamiltonian the point group be use to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates the symmetry classification of the rotational level the eigenstates of the full rovibronic nuclear spin hamiltonian require the use of the appropriate group a introduce by the relation between point group and group be explain in this pdf file link see also link of point assign each molecule a point group classify molecules into category with similar symmetry property for example and all share identical symmetry operation they all can undergo the identity operation e two different rotation operation and three different σv plane reflection without alter their identity so they be place in one point group with order similarly water and hydrogen sulfide also share identical symmetry operation they both undergo the identity operation e one rotation and two σv reflection without alter their identity so they be both place in one point group with order this classification system help scientist to study molecule more efficiently since chemically related molecule in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding scheme molecular bond diagram and spectroscopic property point the follow table contain a list of point group label use the schoenflies notation which be common in chemistry

representation the symmetry operation can be represent in many way a convenient representation be by matrix for any vector represent a point in cartesian coordinate it give the new location of the point transform by the symmetry operation composition of operation corresponds to matrix multiplication within a point group a multiplication of the matrix of two symmetry operation lead to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group for example in the example this be although an infinite number of such representation exist the irreducible representation or irreps of the group be commonly use a all other representation of the group can be describe a a linear combination of the irreducible representation for each point group a table summarizes information on it symmetry operation and on it irreducible representation a there be always equal number of irreducible representation and class of symmetry operation the table be square the table itself consist of that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation be apply any symmetry operation in a molecule point group act on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged but for act on a general entity such a a vector or an orbital this need not be the case the vector could change sign or direction and the orbital could change type for simple point group the value be either or mean that the sign or phase of the vector or orbital be unchanged by the symmetry operation symmetric and denote a sign change asymmetric the representation be label accord to a set of convention a when rotation around the principal axis be symmetrical b when rotation around the principal axis be asymmetrical e and t be doubly and triply degenerate representation respectively when the point group have an inversion center the subscript g or even signal no change in sign and the subscript u ungerade or uneven a change in sign with respect to inversion with point group and the symbol be borrow from angular momentum description σ π δ the table also capture information about how the cartesian basis vector rotation about them and quadratic function of them transform by the symmetry operation of the group by note which irreducible representation transforms in the same way these indication be conventionally on the righthand side of the table this information be useful because chemically important orbitals in particular p and d orbitals have the same symmetry a these entities the character table for the symmetry point group be give below e σv xz σv yz z x y z rz xy x ry xz y rx yz consider the example of water which have the symmetry describe above the p x orbital of oxygen have symmetry a in the fourth row of the character table above with x in the sixth column it be orient perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switch sign with a and a σv yz operation but remain unchanged with the other two operation obviously the character for the identity operation be always this orbital character set be thus correspond to the irreducible representation likewise the p z orbital be see to have the symmetry of the irreducible representation none of the symmetry operation change it p y and the d xy orbital these assignment and others be note in the rightmost two column of the table hans bethe used character of point group operation in his study of ligand field theory in and eugene wigner use group theory to explain the selection rule of atomic spectroscopy the first character table be compile by lászló tisza in connection to vibrational spectrum robert mulliken be the first to publish character table in english and bright wilson use them in to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal mode the complete set of crystallographic point group be publish in by rosenthal and murphy point group be useful for describe rigid molecule which undergo only small oscillation about a single equilibrium geometry and for which the distorting effect of molecular rotation can be ignore so that the symmetry operation all correspond to simple geometrical operation however have introduce a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for rigid molecule but also for molecule that tunnel between equivalent geometry call version and which can also allow for the distorting effect of molecular rotation these group be know a group because the symmetry operation in them be energetically feasible permutation of identical nucleus or inversion with respect to the center of mass or a combination of the two for example ethane have three equivalent stagger conformation tunnel between the conformation occur at ordinary temperature by internal rotation of one methyl group relative to the other this be not a rotation of the entire molecule about the axis although each conformation have symmetry a in the table above description of the internal rotation and associate quantum state and energy level require the more complete group similarly ammonia have two equivalent pyramidal conformation which be interconverted by the process know a nitrogen inversion this be not an inversion in the sense use for point group symmetry operation of rigid molecule the inversion of vibrational displacement and electronic coordinate in the center of mass since have no inversion center rather it the inversion of all nucleus and electron in the center of mass close to the nitrogen atom which happen to be energetically feasible for this molecule the appropriate group to be use in this situation be m which be isomorphic with the point group additionally a example the methane and molecule have highly symmetric equilibrium structure with td and point group symmetries respectively they lack permanent electric dipole moment but they do have very weak pure rotation spectrum because of rotational centrifugal distortion the group require for the complete study of and be td m and m respectively a second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecule be due to altmann in this approach the symmetry group be know a schrödinger supergroups and consist of two type of operation and their combination the geometric symmetry operation rotation reflection inversion of rigid molecule and isodynamic operation which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically reasonable process such a rotation about a single bond a in ethane or a molecular inversion a in ammonia point group group in three dimension of diatomic molecule in quantum mechanic point group symmetry newcastle university

in crystallography method be a family of method for estimate the phase of the fourier transform of the scatter density from the correspond magnitude the method generally exploit constraint or statistical correlation between the phase of different fourier component that result from the fact that the scatter density must be a positive real number in two dimension it be relatively easy to solve the phase problem directly but not so in three dimension the key step be take by hauptman and karle who develop a practical method to employ the sayre equation for which they be award the nobel prize in chemistry the nobel prize citation be for their outstanding achievement in the development of direct method for the determination of crystal structure at present direct method be the preferred method for phase crystal of small molecule have up to atom in the asymmetric unit however they be generally not feasible by themselves for large molecule such a protein several software package implement direct method direct method electron microscopy phase problem crystallography,Direct methods (crystallography),Branches of biology,Biophysics
the bracket be a generalization of the poisson bracket develop by paul dirac to treat classical system with second class constraint in hamiltonian mechanic and to thus allow them to undergo canonical quantization it be an important part of dirac development of hamiltonian mechanic to elegantly handle more general lagrangians specifically when constraint be at hand so that the number of apparent variable exceed that of dynamical one more abstractly the imply from the dirac bracket be the restriction of the symplectic form to the constraint surface in phase space this article assume familiarity with the standard lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism and their connection to canonical quantization detail of dirac modify hamiltonian formalism be also summarize to put the dirac bracket in context the standard development of hamiltonian mechanic be inadequate in several specific situation when the lagrangian be at most linear in the velocity of at least one coordinate in which case the definition of the canonical momentum lead to a constraint this be the most frequent reason to resort to dirac bracket for instance the lagrangian density for any fermion be of this form when there be gauge or other unphysical degree of freedom which need to be fix when there be any other constraint that one wish to impose in phase space example of a lagrangian linear in velocity an example in classical mechanic be a particle with charge and mass confine to the plane with a strong constant homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field so then point in the with strength the lagrangian for this system with an appropriate choice of parameter be where be the vector potential for the magnetic field be the speed of light in vacuum and be an arbitrary external scalar potential one could easily take it to be quadratic in and without loss of generality we use a our vector potential this correspond to a uniform and constant magnetic field b in the z direction here the hat indicate unit vector later in the article however they be use to distinguish quantum mechanical operator from their classical analog the usage should be clear from the context explicitly the lagrangian amount to just which lead to the equation of motion for a harmonic potential the gradient of amount to just the coordinate now in the limit of a very large magnetic field one may then drop the kinetic term to produce a simple approximate lagrangian with equation of motion note that this approximate lagrangian be linear in the velocity which be one of the condition under which the standard hamiltonian procedure break down while this example have be motivate a an approximation the lagrangian under consideration be legitimate and lead to consistent equation of motion in the lagrangian formalism follow the hamiltonian procedure however the canonical momentum associate with the coordinate be now which be unusual in that they be not invertible to the velocity instead they be constrain to be function of the coordinate the four variable be linearly dependent so the variable basis be overcomplete a legendre transformation then produce the hamiltonian note that this naive hamiltonian have no dependence on the momentum which mean that equation of motion hamilton equation be inconsistent the hamiltonian procedure have break down one might try to fix the problem by eliminate two of the component of the phase space say and down to a reduced phase space of dimension that be sometimes express the coordinate a momentum and sometimes a coordinate however this be neither a general nor rigorous solution this get to the heart of the matter that the definition of the canonical momentum imply a constraint on phase space between momentum and coordinate that be never take into account in lagrangian mechanic if the system have holonomic constraint then one generally add lagrange multiplier to the lagrangian to account for them the extra term vanish when the constraint be satisfied thereby force the path of stationary action to be on the constraint surface in this case go to the hamiltonian formalism introduce a constraint on phase space in hamiltonian mechanic but the solution be similar before proceed it be useful to understand the notion of equality and equality two function on phase space and be weakly equal if they be equal when the constraint be satisfy but not throughout the phase space denote if and be equal independently of the constraint be satisfy they be call strongly equal write it be important to note that in order to get the right answer no weak equation may be use before evaluate derivative or poisson bracket the new procedure work a follow start with a lagrangian and define the canonical momentum in the usual way some of those definition may not be invertible and instead give a constraint in phase space a above constraint derive in this way or impose from the beginning of the problem be call constraint the constraint label must weakly vanish next one find the hamiltonian in the usual way via a legendre transformation exactly a in the above example note that the hamiltonian can always be write a a function of s and s only even if the velocity can not be invert into function of the momentum generalize the hamiltonian dirac argue that we should generalize the hamiltonian somewhat analogously to the method of lagrange multiplier to where the be not constant but function of the coordinate and momentum since this new hamiltonian be the most general function of coordinate and momenta weakly equal to the naive hamiltonian be the broad generalization of the hamiltonian possible so that when to further illuminate the consider how one get the equation of motion from the naive hamiltonian in the standard procedure one expand the variation of the hamiltonian out in two way and set them equal use a somewhat abbreviated notation with suppressed index and sum where the second equality hold after simplify with the equation of motion and the definition of canonical momentum from this equality one deduce the equation of motion in the hamiltonian formalism from where the weak equality symbol be no longer display explicitly since by definition the equation of motion only hold weakly in the present context one can not simply set the coefficient of and separately to zero since the variation be somewhat restrict by the constraint in particular the variation must be tangent to the constraint surface one can demonstrate the solution to for the variation and restrict by the constraint assume the constraint satisfy some regularity condition be generally where the be arbitrary function use this result the equation of motion become where the be function of coordinate and velocity that can be determine in principle from the second equation of motion above the legendre transform between the lagrangian formalism and the hamiltonian formalism have be save at the cost of add new variable consistency condition the equation of motion become more compact when use the poisson bracket since if be some function of the coordinate and momentum then if one assume that the poisson bracket with the function of the velocity exist this cause no problem since the contribution weakly vanishes now there be some consistency condition which must be satisfy in order for this formalism to make sense if the constraint be go to be satisfy then their equation of motion must weakly vanish that be we require there be four different type of condition that can result from the above an equation that be inherently false such a an equation that be identically true possibly after use one of our primary constraint an equation that place new constraint on our coordinate and momentum but be independent of the an equation that serve to specify the the first case indicate that the start lagrangian give inconsistent equation of motion such a the second case do not contribute anything new the third case give new constraint in phase space a constraint derive in this manner be call a constraint upon find the secondary constraint one should add it to the extended hamiltonian and check the new consistency condition which may result in still more constraint iterate this process until there be no more constraint the distinction between primary and secondary constraint be largely an artificial one a constraint for the same system can be primary or secondary depending on the lagrangian so this article do not distinguish between them from here on assume the consistency condition have be iterate until all of the constraint have be find then will index all of them note this article use secondary constraint to mean any constraint that be not initially in the problem or derive from the definition of canonical momentum some author distinguish between secondary constraint tertiary constraint et cetera finally the last case help fix the if at the end of this process the be not completely determine then that mean there be unphysical gauge degree of freedom in the system once all of the constraint primary and secondary be add to the naive hamiltonian and the solution to the consistency condition for the be plug in the result be call the total hamiltonian determination of the the u k must solve a set of inhomogeneous linear equation of the form the above equation must possess at least one solution since otherwise the initial lagrangian be inconsistent however in system with gauge degree of freedom the solution will not be unique the most general solution be of the form where be a particular solution and be the most general solution to the homogeneous equation the most general solution will be a linear combination of linearly independent solution to the above homogeneous equation the number of linearly independent solution equal the number of which be the same a the number of constraint minus the number of consistency condition of the fourth type in previous subsection this be the number of unphysical degree of freedom in the system label the linear independent solution where the index run from to the number of unphysical degree of freedom the general solution to the consistency condition be of the form where the be completely arbitrary function of time a different choice of the corresponds to a gauge transformation and should leave the physical state of the system unchanged the total hamiltonian at this point it be natural to introduce the hamiltonian and what be denote the time evolution of a function on the phase space be govern by later the extended hamiltonian be introduce for physically measurable quantity quantities all of the hamiltonians should give the same time evolution since they be all weakly equivalent it be only for quantity that the distinction become important above be everything need to find the equation of motion in dirac modify hamiltonian procedure have the equation of motion however be not the endpoint for theoretical consideration if one want to canonically quantize a general system then one need the dirac bracket before define dirac bracket and constraint need to be introduce we call a function of coordinate and momentum first class if it poisson bracket with all of the constraint weakly vanishes that be for all note that the only quantity that weakly vanish be the constraint and therefore anything that weakly vanishes must be strongly equal to a linear combination of the constraint one can demonstrate that the poisson bracket of two first class quantity must also be first class the first class constraint be intimately connect with the unphysical degree of freedom mention earlier namely the number of independent first class constraint be equal to the number of unphysical degree of freedom and furthermore the primary first class constraint generate gauge transformation dirac far postulate that all secondary first class constraint be generator of gauge transformation which turn out to be false however typically one operate under the assumption that all first class constraint generate gauge transformation when use this treatment when the secondary constraint be add into the hamiltonian with arbitrary a the first class primary constraint be add to arrive at the total hamiltonian then one obtain the hamiltonian the extended hamiltonian give the most general possible time evolution for any quantity and may actually generalize the equation of motion from those of the lagrangian formalism for the purpose of introduce the dirac bracket of more immediate interest be the second class constraint second class constraint be constraint that have nonvanishing poisson bracket with at least one other constraint for instance consider constraint and whose poisson bracket be simply a constant now suppose one wish to employ canonical quantization then the coordinate become operator whose commutator become time their classical poisson bracket assume there be no order issue that give rise to new quantum correction this imply that where the hat emphasize the fact that the constraint be on operator on one hand canonical quantization give the above commutation relation but on the other hand and be constraint that must vanish on physical state whereas the side can not vanish this example illustrate the need for some generalization of the poisson bracket which respect the system constraint and which lead to a consistent quantization procedure this new bracket should be bilinear antisymmetric satisfy the jacobi identity a do the poisson bracket reduce to the poisson bracket for unconstrained system and additionally the bracket of any constraint with any other quantity must vanish at this point the second class constraint will be label define a matrix with entry in this case the dirac bracket of two function on phase space and be define a where denote the entry of inverse matrix dirac prove that will always be invertible it be straightforward to check that the above definition of the dirac bracket satisfy all of the desired property and especially the last one of vanish for an argument which be a constraint when apply canonical quantization on a constrain hamiltonian system the commutator of the operator be supplant by time their classical dirac bracket since the dirac bracket respect the constraint one need not be careful about evaluate all bracket before use any weak equation a be the case with the poisson bracket note that while the poisson bracket of bosonic grassmann even variable with itself must vanish the poisson bracket of fermion represent a a grassmann variables with itself need not vanish this mean that in the fermionic case it be possible for there to be an odd number of second class constraint return to the above example the naive hamiltonian and the two primary constraint be therefore the extended hamiltonian can be write the next step be to apply the consistency condition which in this case become these be not secondary constraint but condition that fix and therefore there be no secondary constraint and the arbitrary coefficient be completely determine indicate that there be no unphysical degree of freedom if one plug in with the value of and then one can see that the equation of motion be which be and coincide with the lagrangian equation of motion a simple calculation confirms that and be second class constraint since hence the matrix look like which be easily invert to where be the symbol thus the dirac bracket be define to be if one always use the dirac bracket instead of the poisson bracket then there be no issue about the order of apply constraint and evaluate expression since the dirac bracket of anything weakly zero be strongly equal to zero this mean that one can just use the naive hamiltonian with dirac bracket instead to thus get the correct equation of motion which one can easily confirm on the above one to quantize the system the dirac bracket between all of the phase space variable be need the nonvanishing dirac bracket for this system be while the vanish and therefore the correct implementation of canonical quantization dictate the commutation relation with the cross term vanish and this example have a nonvanishing commutator between and which mean this structure specify a noncommutative geometry since the two coordinate do not commute there will be an uncertainty principle for the and position similarly for free motion on a hypersphere the coordinate be constrain from a plain kinetic lagrangian it be evident that their momentum be perpendicular to them thus the corresponding dirac bracket be likewise simple to work out the constrained variable obey much simpler dirac bracket than the unconstrained variable have one eliminate one of the s and one of the s through the two constraint ab initio which would obey plain poisson bracket the dirac bracket add simplicity and elegance at the cost of excessive constrain variable for example for free motion on a circle for and eliminate from the circle constraint yield the unconstrained with equation of motion an oscillation whereas the equivalent constrain system with yield whence instantly virtually by inspection

the identity element of the sandpile group of a rectangular grid yellow pixel correspond to vertex carry three particle lilac to two particle green to one and black to zero the sandpile model also know a the model be the first discovered example of a dynamical system display criticality it be introduce by per bak chao tang and kurt wiesenfeld in a paper the model be a cellular automaton in it original formulation each site on a finite grid have an associate value that correspond to the slope of the pile this slope build up a grain of sand or chip be randomly place onto the pile until the slope exceed a specific threshold value at which time that site collapse transfer sand into the adjacent site increase their slope bak tang and wiesenfeld consider process of successive random placement of sand grain on the grid each such placement of sand at a particular site may have no effect or it may cause a cascading reaction that will affect many site the model have since be study on the infinite lattice on other lattice and on arbitrary graph include direct multigraphs it be closely relate to the dollar game a variant of the game introduce by biggs the sandpile model be a cellular automaton originally define on a rectangular grid checkerboard of the standard square lattice to each vertex side field of the grid we associate a value grain of sand slope particle with referred to a the initial configuration of the sandpile the dynamic of the automaton at iteration be then define a follow choose a random vertex accord to some probability distribution usually uniform add one grain of sand to this vertex while let the grain number for all other vertex unchanged set and for all if all vertex be stable for all also the configuration be say to be stable in this case continue with the next iteration if at least one vertex be unstable for some the whole configuration be say to be unstable in this case choose any unstable vertex at random this vertex by reduce it grain number by four and by increase the grain number of each of it at maximum four direct neighbor by one set and if a vertex at the boundary of the domain topple this result in a net loss of grain two grain at the corner of the grid one grain otherwise due to the redistribution of grain the toppling of one vertex can render other vertex unstable thus repeat the toppling procedure until all vertex of eventually become stable and continue with the next iteration the toppling of several vertex during one iteration be refer to a an avalanche every avalanche be guarantee to eventually stop after a finite number of topplings some stable configuration be reach such that the automaton be well define moreover although there will often be many possible choice for the order in which to topple vertex the final stable configuration do not depend on the chosen order this be one sense in which the sandpile be a belian similarly the number of time each vertex topples during each iteration be also independent of the choice of topple order to generalize the sandpile model from the rectangular grid of the standard square lattice to an arbitrary undirected finite multigraph without loop a special vertex call the sink be specify that be not allow to topple a configuration state of the model be then a function count the number of grain on each vertex a vertex with be unstable it can be topple which send one of it grain to each of it neighbor for all the cellular automaton then progress a before by add in each iteration one particle to a randomly choose vertex and topple until all vertex be stable the definition of the sandpile model give above for finite rectangular grid of the standard square lattice can then be see a a special case of this definition consider the graph which be obtain from by add an additional vertex the sink and by draw additional edge from the sink to every boundary vertex of such that the degree of every vertex of be four in this manner also sandpile model on grid of the standard square lattice or of any other lattice can be define intersect some bounded subset of with contract every edge of whose two endpoint be not in the single remain vertex outside of then constitute the sink of the result sandpile graph in the dynamic of the sandpile automaton define above some stable configuration for all appear infinitely often while others can only appear a finite number of time if at all the former be refer to a recurrent configuration while the latter be refer to a transient configuration the recurrent configuration thereby consist of all stable configuration which can be reach from any other stable configuration by repeatadly add grain of sand to vertex and topple it be easy to see that the minimally stable configuration where every vertex carry grain of sand be reachable from any other stable configuration add grain to every vertex thus equivalently the recurrent configuration be exactly those configuration which can be reach from the minimally stable configuration by only add grain of sand and stabilize not every stable configuration be recurrent for example in every sandpile model on a graph consisting of at least two connected vertex every stable configuration where both vertex carry zero grain of sand be to prove this first note that the addition of grain of sand can only increase the total number of grain carry by the two vertex together to reach a configuration where both vertex carry zero particle from a configuration where this be not the case thus necessarily involve step where at least one of the two vertex be topple consider the last one of these step in this step one of the two vertex have to topple last since topple transfer a grain of sand to every neighbor vertex this imply that the total number of grain carry by both vertex together can not be low than one which conclude the proof give a configuration for all topple unstable vertex on a finite connect graph until no unstable vertex remain lead to a unique stable configuration which be call the stabilization of give two stable configuration and we can define the operation correspond to the addition of grain follow by the stabilization of the result sandpile give an arbitrary but fixed ordering of the vertex multiple topple operation which can occur during the stabilization of an unstable configuration can be efficiently encode by use the graph laplacian where be the degree matrix and be the adjacency matrix of the graph delete the row and column of correspond with the sink yield the reduced graph laplacian then when start with a configuration and topple each vertex a total of time yield the configuration where be the contraction product furthermore if corresponds to the number of time each vertex be topple during the stabilization of a give configuration then in this case be refer to a the toppling or odometer function of the stabilization of under the operation the set of recurrent configuration form an abelian group isomorphic to the cokernel of the reduced graph laplacian to whereby denote the number of vertex include the sink more generally the set of stable configuration transient and recurrent form a commutative monoid under the operation the minimal ideal of this monoid be then isomorphic to the group of recurrent configuration the group form by the recurrent configuration as well a the group to which the former be isomorphic be most commonly refer to a the sandpile group other common name for the same group be critical group jacobian group or less often picard group note however that some author only denote the group form by the recurrent configuration a the sandpile group while reserve the name jacobian group or critical group for the isomorphic group define by or for related isomorphic definition finally some author use the name picard group to refer to the direct product of the sandpile group and which naturally appear in a cellular automaton closely relate to the sandpile model refer to a the chip firing or dollar game give the isomorphism state above the order of the sandpile group be the determinant of which by the matrix tree theorem be the number of span tree of the graph the original interest behind the model stem from the fact that in simulation on lattice it be attract to it critical state at which point the correlation length of the system and the correlation time of the system go to infinity without any fine tuning of a system parameter this contrast with early example of critical phenomenon such a the phase transition between solid and liquid or liquid and gas where the critical point can only be reach by precise tuning of temperature hence in the sandpile model we can say that the criticality be once the sandpile model reach it critical state there be no correlation between the system response to a perturbation and the detail of a perturbation generally this mean that drop another grain of sand onto the pile may cause nothing to happen or it may cause the entire pile to collapse in a massive slide the model also display ƒ noise a feature common to many complex system in nature this model only display critical behaviour in two or more dimension the sandpile model can be express in however instead of evolve to it critical state the sandpile model instead reach a minimally stable state where every lattice site go toward the critical slope for two dimension the associate conformal field theory be suggest to be symplectic fermion with central charge c action the stabilization of chip configuration obey a form of least action principle each vertex topple no more than necessary in the course of the stabilization this can be formalize a follow call a sequence of topples legal if it only topple unstable vertex and stabilize if it result in a stable configuration the standard way of stabilize the sandpile be to find a maximal legal sequence by topple so long a it be possible such a sequence be obviously stabilizing and the abelian property of the sandpile be that all such sequence be equivalent up to permutation of the topple order that be for any vertex the number of time topples be the same in all legal stabilizing sequence accord to the least action principle a stabilizing sequence be also equivalent up to permutation of the topple order to a legal and still stabilize sequence in particular the configuration result from a minimal stabilizing sequence be the same a result from a maximal legal sequence more formally if be a vector such that be the number of time the vertex topples during the stabilization via the toppling of unstable vertex of a chip configuration and be an integral vector not necessarily such that be stable then for all vertex scale limit animation of the sandpile identity on square grid of increase size black color denote vertex with grain green be for purple be for and gold be for the animation show the recurrent configuration correspond to the identity of the sandpile group on different square grid of increase sizes whereby the configuration be rescale to always have the same physical dimension visually the identity on large grid seem to become more and more detailed and to converge to a continuous image mathematically this suggest the existence of of the sandpile identity on square grid base on the notion of convergence or some other generalized notion of convergence indeed existence of scale limit of recurrent sandpile configuration have be prove by wesley pegden and charles smart in further joint work with lionel levine they use the scaling limit to explain the fractal structure of the sandpile on square grid sandpile model on infinite grid million grain drop to a site of the infinite square grid then topple accord to the rule of the sandpile model white color denotes sit with grain green be for purple be for gold be for the bounding box be there exist several generalization of the sandpile model to infinite grid a challenge in such generalization be that in general it be not guarantee anymore that every avalanche will eventually stop several of the generalization thus only consider the stabilization of configuration for which this can be guarantee a rather popular model on the infinite square lattice with site be define a follow begin with some nonnegative configuration of value which be finite mean any site with be unstable and can topple or fire send one of it chip to each of it four neighbor since the initial configuration be finite the process be guarantee to terminate with the grain scatter outward a popular special case of this model be give when the initial configuration be zero for all vertex except the origin if the origin carry a huge number of grain of sand the configuration after relaxation form fractal pattern see figure when let the initial number of grain at the origin go to infinity the rescaled stabilized configuration be show to converge to a unique limit sandpile model on directed graph the sandpile model can be generalize to arbitrary directed multigraphs the rule be that any vertex with be unstable topple again send chip to each of it neighbor one along each outgo edge and for each where be the number of edge from to in this case the laplacian matrix be not symmetric if we specify a sink such that there be a path from every other vertex to then the stabilization operation on finite graph be and the sandpile group can be write a before the order of the sandpile group be again the determinant of which by the general version of the matrix tree theorem be the number of oriented span tree root at the sink the extend sandpile model sandpile dynamic induce by the harmonic function on a square grid to good understand the structure of the sandpile group for different finite convex grid of the standard square lattice lang and shkolnikov introduce the extended sandpile model in the extended sandpile model be define nearly exactly the same a the usual sandpile model the original model except that vertex at the boundary of the grid be now allow to carry a real number of grain in contrast vertex in the interior of the grid be still only allow to carry integer number of grain the toppling rule remain unchanged both interior and boundary vertex be assume to become unstable and topple if the grain number reach or exceed four also the recurrent configuration of the extended sandpile model form an abelian group refer to a the extended sandpile group of which the usual sandpile group be a discrete subgroup different to the usual sandpile group the extend sandpile group be however a continuous lie group since it be generate by only add grain of sand to the boundary of the grid the extended sandpile group furthermore have the topology of a torus of dimension and a volume give by the order of the usual sandpile group of specific interest be the question how the recurrent configuration dynamically change along the continuous geodesic of this torus pass through the identity this question lead to the definition of the sandpile dynamic extend sandpile model respectively usual sandpile model induce by the harmonic function at time with the identity of the sandpile group and the floor function for polynomial harmonic function the sandpile dynamic be characterize by the smooth transformation and apparent conservation of the patch constitute the sandpile identity for example the harmonic dynamic induce by resemble the smooth stretching of the identity along the main diagonal visualize in the animation the configuration appear in the dynamic induce by the same harmonic function on square grid of different size be furthermore conjecture to converge mean that there supposedly exist scale limit for them this propose a natural renormalization for the extended and usual sandpile group mean a mapping of recurrent configuration on a give grid to recurrent configuration on a informaly this renormalization simply maps configuration appear at a give time in the sandpile dynamic induce by some harmonic function on the large grid to the corresponding configuration which appear at the same time in the sandpile dynamic induce by the restriction of to the respective the divisible sandpile a strongly related model be the so call sandpile model introduce by levine and peres in in which instead of a discrete number of particle in each site there be a real number represent the amount of mass on the site in case such mass be negative one can understand it a a hole the topple occur whenever a site have mass large than it topple the excess evenly between it neighbor result in the situation that if a site be full at time it will be full for all later time the sandpile be mention

in theoretical physic renormalization group be an implementation of the renormalization group rg concept which be use in quantum and statistical field theory especially when deal with strongly interact system the method combine functional method of quantum field theory with the intuitive renormalization group idea of kenneth wilson this technique allow to interpolate smoothly between the know microscopic law and the complicate macroscopic phenomenon in physical system in this sense it bridge the transition from simplicity of microphysics to complexity of macrophysics figuratively speak frg act a a microscope with a variable resolution one start with a picture of the known microphysical law and subsequently decrease the resolution to obtain a picture of macroscopic collective phenomenon the method be nonperturbative meaning that it do not rely on an expansion in a small coupling constant mathematically frg be base on an exact functional differential equation for a effective action in quantum field theory the effective action be an analogue of the classical action functional and depend on the field of a give theory it include all quantum and thermal fluctuation variation of yield exact quantum field equation for example for cosmology or the electrodynamics of superconductors mathematically be the generate functional of the irreducible feynman diagram interest physic a propagator and effective coupling for interaction can be straightforwardly extract from it in a generic interacting field theory the effective action however be difficult to obtain frg provide a practical tool to calculate employ the renormalization group concept the central object in frg be a effective action functional often call average action or flow action the dependence on the rg slide scale be introduce by add a regulator infrared cutoff to the full inverse propagator roughly speak the regulator decouple slow mode with momentum by give them a large mass while high momentum mode be not affected thus include all quantum and statistical fluctuation with momentum the flow action obeys the exact functional flow equation derive by christof wetterich and tim morris in here denote a derivative with respect to the rg scale at fixed value of the field furthermore denote the functional derivative of from the and the respectively due to the tensor structure of the equation this feature be often show simplify by the second derivative of the effective action the functional differential equation for must be supplement with the initial condition where the classical action describe the physic at the microscopic ultraviolet scale importantly in the infrared limit the full effective action be obtain in the equation denote a supertrace which sum over momenta frequency internal index and field take boson with a plus and fermion with a minus sign the exact flow equation for have a structure this be an important simplification compare to perturbation theory where diagram must be include the second functional derivative be the full inverse field propagator modify by the presence of the regulator the renormalization group evolution of can be illustrate in the theory space which be a space of all possible running coupling allow by the symmetry of the problem a schematically show in the figure at the microscopic ultraviolet scale one start with the initial condition renormalization group flow in the theory space of all possible coupling allow by symmetry a the slide scale be lower the flow action evolves in the theory space accord to the functional flow equation the choice of the regulator be not unique which introduce some scheme dependence into the renormalization group flow for this reason different choice of the regulator correspond to the different path in the figure at the infrared scale however the full effective action be recover for every choice of the and all trajectory meet at the same point in the theory space in most case of interest the wetterich equation can only be solve approximately usually some type of expansion of be perform which be then truncate at finite order lead to a finite system of ordinary differential equation different systematic expansion scheme such a the derivative expansion vertex expansion etc be develop the choice of the suitable scheme should be physically motivate and depend on a give problem the expansion do not necessarily involve a small parameter like an interaction couple constant and thus they be in general of nonperturbative nature the wetterich flow equation be an exact equation however in practice the functional differential equation must be truncate it must be project to function of a few variable or even onto some space a in every nonperturbative method the question of error estimate be nontrivial in functional renormalization one way to estimate the error in frg be to improve the truncation in successive step to enlarge the space by include more and more running coupling the difference in the flow for different truncation give a good estimate of the error alternatively one can use different regulator function in a give fix truncation and determine the difference of the rg flow in the infrared for the respective regulator choice if bosonization be use one can check the insensitivity of final result with respect to different bosonization procedure in frg a in all rg method a lot of insight about a physical system can be gain from the topology of rg flow specifically identification of fixed point of the renormalization group evolution be of great importance near fix point the flow of run coupling effectively stop and rg approach zero the presence of partially stable infrared fixed point be closely connect to the concept of universality universality manifest itself in the observation that some very distinct physical system have the same critical behavior for instance to good accuracy critical exponent of the phase transition in water and the ferromagnetic phase transition in magnet be the same in the renormalization group language different system from the same universality class flow to the same partially stable infrared fix point in this way macrophysics become independent of the microscopic detail of the particular physical model compare to the perturbation theory functional renormalization do not make a strict distinction between renormalizable and nonrenormalizable coupling all running coupling that be allow by symmetry of the problem be generate during the frg flow however the nonrenormalizable coupling approach partial fixed point very quickly during the evolution towards the infrared and thus the flow effectively collapse on a hypersurface of the dimension give by the number of renormalizable coupling take the nonrenormalizable coupling into account allow to study nonuniversal feature that be sensitive to the concrete choice of the microscopic action and the finite ultraviolet cutoff the wetterich equation can be obtain from the legendre transformation of the polchinski functional equation derive by joseph polchinski in the concept of the effective average action use in frg be however more intuitive than the flow bare action in the polchinski equation in addition the frg method prove to be more suitable for practical calculation typically physic of strongly interact system be describe by macroscopic degree of freedom particle excitation which be very different from microscopic degree of freedom for instance quantum chromodynamics be a field theory of interact quark and gluon at low energy however proper degree of freedom be baryon and meson another example be the crossover problem in condensed matter physic while the microscopic theory be define in term of nonrelativistic fermion at low energy a composite dimer become an additional degree of freedom and it be advisable to include it explicitly in the model the composite degree of freedom can be introduce in the description by the method of partial bosonization transformation this transformation however be do once and for all at the uv scale in frg a more efficient way to incorporate macroscopic degree of freedom be introduce which be know a flow bosonization or rebosonization with the help of a field transformation this allow to perform the transformation continuously at all rg scale contrary to the flow equation for the effective action this scheme be formulate for the effective interaction which generate interaction vertex amputate by the bare propagator be the standard generate functional for the green function the wick ordering of effective interaction with respect to green function can be define by where be the laplacian in the field space this operation be similar to normal order and excludes from the interaction all possible term form by a convolution of source field with respective green function introduce some cutoff the polchinskii equation take the form of the equation where the method be apply to numerous problem in physic in statistical field theory frg provide a unified picture of phase transition in classical linear scalar theory in

macroscopic quantum phenomenon refer to process show quantum behavior at the macroscopic scale rather than at the atomic scale where quantum effect be prevalent the example of macroscopic quantum phenomenon be superfluidity and superconductivity other example include the quantum hall effect giant magnetoresistance and topological order since there have be extensive experimental work on quantum gas particularly condensate between and six nobel prize be give for work relate to macroscopic quantum phenomenon macroscopic quantum phenomenon can be observe in superfluid helium and in superconductors but also in dilute quantum gas dress photon such a polaritons and in laser light although these medium be very different their behavior be very similar a they all show macroscopic quantum behavior and to such extent they all can be refer to a quantum fluid quantum phenomenon be generally classify a macroscopic when the quantum state be occupy by a large number of particle typically avogadro number or the quantum state involve be macroscopic in size up to km size in superconducting wire right only one particle usually the small box be empty however there be a certain chance that the particle be in the box this chance be give by middle a few particle there be usually some particle in the box we can define an average but the actual number of particle in the box have large fluctuation around this average right small number of particle of particle the fluctuation around the average be small the concept of quantum state be introduce by fritz london in this section it will be explain what it mean if a single state be occupy by a very large number of particle we start with the wave function of the state write a with ψ the amplitude and the phase the wave function be normalize so that the physical interpretation of the quantity depend on the number of particle represent a container with a certain number of particle with a small control volume δ v inside we check from time to time how many particle be in the control box we distinguish three case there be only one particle in this case the control volume be empty most of the time however there be a certain chance to find the particle in it give by the chance be proportional to δ v the factor ψψ be call the chance density if the number of particle be a bit large there be usually some particle inside the box we can define an average but the actual number of particle in the box have relatively large fluctuation around this average in the case of a very large number of particle there will always be a lot of particle in the small box the number will fluctuate but the fluctuation around the average be relatively small the average number be proportional to δ v and ψψ be now interpret a the particle density in quantum mechanic the particle probability flow density j p unit particle per second per also call probability current can be derive from the schrödinger equation to be with q the charge of the particle and the vector potential cc stand for the complex conjugate of the other term inside the bracket for neutral particle for superconductors with e the elementary charge the charge of cooper pair with eq if the wave function be macroscopically occupy the particle probability flow density become a particle flow density we introduce the fluid velocity v s via the mass flow density the density mass per be so eq result in this important relation connect the velocity a classical concept of the condensate with the phase of the wave function a concept lower part vertical cross section of a column of superfluid helium rotate around a vertical axis upper part top view of the surface show the pattern of vortex core from leave to right the rotation speed be increase result in an increase density at temperature below the lambda point helium show the unique property of superfluidity the fraction of the liquid that form the superfluid component be a macroscopic quantum fluid the helium atom be a neutral particle so q furthermore when consider the relevant particle mass be so eq reduces to for an arbitrary loop in the liquid this give due to the nature of the wave function with n integer we have the quantity be the quantum of circulation for a circular motion with radius r in case of a single quantum n when superfluid helium be put in rotation eq will not be satisfy for all loop inside the liquid unless the rotation be organize around vortex line a depict in these line have a vacuum core with a diameter of about å which be small than the average particle distance the superfluid helium rotate around the core with very high speed just outside the core r å the velocity be as large a the core of the vortex line and the container rotate a a solid body around the rotation ax with the same angular velocity the number of vortex line increase with the angular velocity a show in the upper half of the figure note that the two right figure both contain six vortex line but the line be organize in different stable pattern in the original paper ginzburg and landau observe the existence of two type of superconductors depend on the energy of the interface between the normal and superconducting meissner state break down when the applied magnetic field be too large superconductors can be divide into two class accord to how this breakdown occur in type i superconductors superconductivity be abruptly destroy when the strength of the applied field rise above a critical value hc depend on the geometry of the sample one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of region of normal material carry a magnetic field mixed with region of superconducting material contain no field in type ii superconductors raise the applied field past a critical value h lead to a mixed state also know a the vortex state in which an increase amount of magnetic flux penetrate the material but there remain no resistance to the flow of electric current as long a the current be not too large at a second critical field strength h superconductivity be destroy the mixed state be actually cause by vortex in the electronic superfluid sometimes call fluxons because the flux carry by these vortex be quantize most pure elemental superconductors except niobium and carbon nanotube be type i while almost all impure and compound superconductors be type ii the most important finding from theory be make by alexei abrikosov in he use theory to explain experiment on superconducting alloy and thin film he find that in a superconductor in a high magnetic field the field penetrate in a triangular lattice of quantized tube of flux vortex for superconductors the boson involve be the cooper pair which be quasiparticle form by two electron hence m m e and q e where m e and e be the mass of an electron and the elementary charge it follow from eq that integrate eq over a closed loop give a in the case of helium we define the vortex strength and use the general relation where φ be the magnetic flux enclose by the loop the fluxoid be define by in general the value of κ and φ depend on the choice of the loop due to the nature of the wave function and eq the fluxoid be quantize the unit of quantization be call the flux quantum wb the flux quantum play a very important role in superconductivity the earth magnetic field be very small about μt but it generate one flux quantum in an area of by μm so the flux quantum be very small yet it be measure to an accuracy of digit a show in nowadays the value give by eq be exact by definition fig two superconducting ring in an applied magnetic field a thick superconducting ring the integration loop be completely in the region with v b thick superconducting ring with a weak link the integration loop be completely in the region with v except for a small region near the weak link in fig two situation be depict of superconducting ring in an external magnetic field one case be a ring and in the other case the ring be also but be interrupt by a weak link in the latter case we will meet the famous josephson relation in both case we consider a loop inside the material in general a superconducting circulation current will flow in the material the total magnetic flux in the loop be the sum of the applied flux φ a and the flux φ s induce by the circulation current the first case be a thick ring in an external magnetic field fig the current in a superconductor only flow in a thin layer at the surface the thickness of this layer be determine by the london penetration depth it be of μm size or less we consider a loop far away from the surface so that v everywhere so κ in that case the fluxoid be equal to the magnetic flux φ φ if v eq reduces to take the rotation give use the relation and show that the magnetic field in the bulk of the superconductor be zero as well so for thick ring the total magnetic flux in the loop be quantize accord to ring weak fig schematic of a weak link carry a superconducting current i s the voltage difference over the link be v the phase of the superconducting wave function at the left and right side be assume to be constant in space not in time with value of φ and φ respectively weak link play a very important role in modern superconductivity in most case weak link be oxide barrier between two superconducting thin film but it can also be a crystal boundary in the case of superconductors a schematic representation be give in fig now consider the ring which be thick everywhere except for a small section where the ring be close via a weak link fig the velocity be zero except near the weak link in these region the velocity contribution to the total phase change in the loop be give by with eq the line integral be over the contact from one side to the other in such a way that the end point of the line be well inside the bulk of the superconductor where v so the value of the line integral be independent of the choice of the end point with eq and without proof we state that the supercurrent through the weak link be give by the dc josephson relation the voltage over the contact be give by the ac josephson relation the name of these relation dc and ac relation be mislead since they both hold in dc and ac situation in the steady state constant eq show that v while a nonzero current flow through the junction in the case of a constant applied voltage voltage bias eq can be integrate easily and give substitution in eq give this be an ac current the frequency be call the josephson frequency one μv give a frequency of about mhz by use eq the flux quantum be determine with the high precision a give in the energy difference of a cooper pair move from one side of the contact to the other be δ e ev with this expression eq can be write a δ e hν which be the relation for the energy of a photon with frequency ν the ac josephson relation eq can be easily understand in term of newton law or from one of the london equation we start with newton law substitute the expression for the lorentz force and use the general expression for the time derivative give eq give so take the line integral of this expression in the end point the velocity be zero so the term give no contribution use and eq with q e and m m e give fig two superconductors connect by two weak link a current and a magnetic field be apply fig dependence of the critical current of a on the applied magnetic field figure show a dc squid it consist of two superconductors connect by two weak link the fluxoid quantization of a loop through the two bulk superconductors and the two weak link demand if the of the loop can be neglect the magnetic flux in the loop φ be equal to the apply flux with b the magnetic field apply perpendicular to the surface and a the surface area of the loop the total supercurrent be give by substitution of eq in give use a well know geometrical formula we get since the can vary only between and a steady solution be only possible if the applied current be below a critical current give by note that the critical current be periodic in the applied flux with period the dependence of the critical current on the applied flux be depict in fig it have a strong resemblance with the interference pattern generate by a laser beam behind a double slit in practice the critical current be not zero at half integer value of the flux quantum of the applied flux this be due to the fact that the of the loop can not be neglect ii fig magnetic flux line penetrate a superconductor the current in the superconducting material generate a magnetic field which together with the applied field result in bundle of quantized flux superconductivity be characterize by two critical field call b and b at a magnetic field b the applied magnetic field start to penetrate the sample but the sample be still superconducting only at a field of b the sample be completely normal for field in between b and b magnetic flux penetrate the superconductor in pattern the abrikosov vortex lattice similar to the pattern show in fig a cross section of the superconducting plate be give in fig far away from the plate the field be homogeneous but in the material superconducting current flow which squeeze the field in bundle of exactly one flux quantum the typical field in the core be as big a tesla the current around the vortex core flow in a layer of about nm with current density on the order of that correspond with million ampère in a wire of one the classical type of quantum

dna damage be distinctly different from mutation although both be type of error in dna dna damage be an abnormal chemical structure in dna while a mutation be a change in the sequence of standard base pair dna damage cause change in the structure of the genetic material and prevent the replication mechanism from function and perform properly dna damage and mutation have different biological consequence while most dna damage can undergo dna repair such repair be not efficient dna damage accumulate in cell such a cell in the brain or muscle of adult mammal and can cause age also see dna damage theory of age in replicate cell such a cell line the colon error occur upon replication past damage in the template strand of dna or during repair of dna damage these error can give rise to mutation or epigenetic alteration both of these type of alteration can be replicate and pass on to subsequent cell generation these alteration can change gene function or regulation of gene expression and possibly contribute to progression to cancer throughout the cell cycle there be various checkpoint to ensure the cell be in good condition to progress to mitosis the three main checkpoint be at and at the spindle assembly checkpoint regulating progression through anaphase and checkpoint involve scan for damage dna during s phase the cell be more vulnerable to dna damage than any other part of the cell cycle checkpoint check for damage dna and dna replication completeness dna damage be an alteration in the chemical structure of dna such a a break in a strand of dna a base miss from the backbone of dna or a chemically change base such a dna damage can occur naturally or via environmental factor the dna damage response ddr be a complex signal transduction pathway which recognize when dna be damage and initiate the cellular response to the damage damage to dna that occur naturally can result from metabolic or hydrolytic process metabolism release compound that damage dna include reactive oxygen specie reactive nitrogen specie reactive carbonyl specie lipid peroxidation product and alkylating agent among others while hydrolysis cleaves chemical bond in dna naturally occur oxidative dna damage arise at least time per cell per day in human and time or more per cell per day in rat a document below oxidative dna damage can produce more than type of altered base as well a single strand break other type of endogeneous dna damage give below with their frequency of occurrence include depurinations depyrimidinations break and cytosine deamination dna can be damage via environmental factor a well environmental agent such a uv light ionize radiation and genotoxic chemical replication fork can be stall due to damage dna and double strand break be also a form of dna damage the list below show some frequency with which new naturally occur dna damage arise per day due to endogenous cellular process oxidative damage human per cell per day specific damage plus specific damage plus rat per cell per day per cell per day specific damage plus specific damage in mouse specific damage cell per cell per day to cell per cell per day break cell per cell per day break cell per cell cycle cell per cell per day deamination mammalian cell per cell per day another important endogenous dna damage be short for the excretion in urine likely reflect rate of occurrence of may be as much a low than that of however a more important measure may be the level in dna reflect both rate of occurrence and rate of dna repair the level of be high than that of this point out that some dna damage produce at a low rate may be difficult to repair and remain in dna at a high level both and be mutagenic level of dna damage represent the balance between formation and repair more than type of oxidative dna damage have be characterize and constitute about of the steady state oxidative damage in dna helbock et al estimate that there be steady state oxidative dna adduct per cell in young rat and adduct per cell in old rat this reflect the accumulation of dna damage with age dna damage accumulation with age be further describe in dna damage theory of age swenberg et al measure average amount of select steady state endogenous dna damage in mammalian cell the seven most common damage they evaluate be show in table table amount of endogenous dna damage endogenous lesion number per cell abasic sit guanine guanine formaldehyde adduct evaluate damage in specific tissue of the rat nakamura and swenberg indicate that the number of abasic site vary from about per cell in liver kidney and lung to about per cell in the brain proteins promote endogenous dna damage be identify in a paper a the dna proteins ddps the ddp mechanisms fall into cluster reactive oxygen increase by transmembrane transporter chromosome loss by replisome bind replication stalling by transcription factor the ddp human homologs be in known cancer driver and their rna in tumor predict heavy mutagenesis and a poor prognosis in the presence of dna damage the cell can either repair the damage or induce cell death if the damage be beyond repair the seven main type of dna repair and one pathway of damage tolerance the lesion they address and the accuracy of the repair or tolerance be show in this table for a brief description of the step in repair see dna repair mechanism or see each individual pathway major pathway of dna repair and one tolerance mechanism repair pathway lesion accuracy ref base excision repair correct dna damage from oxidation deamination and alkylation also break accurate nucleotide excision repair oxidative endogenous lesion such a cyclopurine thymine dimer cyclobutane dimer and pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproducts accurate homologous recombinational repair break in the phase or phase of the cell cycle accurate end join break if cell be in the phase the phase or the phase of the cell cycle somewhat inaccurate end joining or join break in the s phase of the cell cycle always inaccurate dna mismatch repair base substitution mismatch and mismatch generate during dna replication accurate direct reversal mgmt and alkb be reverse to guanine by mgmt some other methylated base be demethylated by alkb accurate translesion synthesis dna damage tolerance process that allow the dna replication machinery to replicate past dna lesion may be inaccurate dna damage in cell if not repair and accumulate can lead to age dna damage in replicate cell if not repair can lead to either apoptosis or to cancer the schematic diagram indicate the role of insufficient dna repair in age and cancer and the role of apoptosis in cancer prevention an excess of naturally occur dna damage due to inherited deficiency in particular dna repair enzyme can cause premature age or increase risk for cancer see dna disorder on the other hand the ability to trigger apoptosis in the presence of excess dna damage be critical for prevention of cancer dna repair protein be often activate or induce when dna have sustain damage however excessive dna damage can initiate apoptosis program cell death if the level of dna damage exceed the repair capacity apoptosis can prevent cell with excess dna damage from undergo mutagenesis and progression to cancer inflammation be often cause by infection such a with hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv or helicobacter pylori chronic inflammation be also a central characteristic of obesity such inflammation cause oxidative dna damage this be due to the induction of reactive oxygen specie ros by various intracellular inflammatory mediator hbv and hcv infection in particular cause and increase in intracellular ro production respectively ros that cause dna damage can trigger apoptosis but may also cause cancer if repair and apoptotic process be insufficiently protective bile acid store in the gall bladder be release into the small intestine in response to fat in the diet high level of fat cause great release bile acid cause dna damage include oxidative dna damage dna break aneuploidy and chromosome breakage level of the bile acid deoxycholic acid cause apoptosis in human colon cell but may also lead to colon cancer if repair and apoptotic defense be insufficient apoptosis serf a a safeguard mechanism against tumorigenesis it prevent the increased mutagenesis that excess dna damage could cause upon replication at least dna repair protein distribute among five dna repair pathway have a dual role in response to dna damage with moderate level of dna damage these protein initiate or contribute to dna repair however when excessive level of dna damage be present they trigger apoptosis the packaging of eukaryotic dna into chromatin be a barrier to all process that require enzyme action for most dna repair process the chromatin must be remodel in eukaryote chromatin remodel complex and enzyme be two factor that act to accomplish this remodeling process after dna damage occur further dna repair step involve multiple enzyme usually follow some of the first response to dna damage with their timing be describe below more complete description of the dna repair pathway be present in article describe each pathway at least enzyme be involve in dna repair pathways excision oxidize base in dna be produce in cell treat with hoechst dye follow by with nm light such oxidized base can be repair by base excision repair when the nm light be focus along a narrow line within the nucleus of a cell about second after irradiation the chromatin remodel enzyme achieves recruitment onto the irradiated the line of chromatin that be irradiate then relax expand over the next second within second of the irradiation with nm light there be recruitment of to the irradiated line be an enzyme that remove the oxidative dna damage from dna removal of during base excision repair occur with a of minute excision ultraviolet uv light induce the formation of dna damage include pyrimidine dimer such a thymine dimer and photoproducts these type of bulky damage be repair by nucleotide excision repair after irradiation with uv light in a complex with the ubiquitin ligase protein and the

on that attract the dna remodel protein relaxes chromatin at site of uv damage to dna in addition the ubiquitin ligase complex carry out ubiquitination of the core histone and as well a the repair protein xpc which have be attract to the site of the dna damage xpc upon ubiquitination be activate and initiate the nucleotide excision repair pathway somewhat later at minute after uv damage the chromatin remodel complex be recruit to the site of the dna damage and this coincide with the binding of further nucleotide excision repair proteins include recombinational break dsbs at specific site can be induce by transfecting cell with a plasmid encode endonuclease a homing endonuclease multiple dsbs can be induce by irradiate sensitized cell label with and with hoechst dye with nm light these dsbs can be repair by the accurate homologous recombinational repair or by the less accurate end join repair pathway here we describe the early step in homologous recombinational repair hrr after treat cell to introduce dsbs the protein kinase kinase jnk phosphorylates on serine this modification facilitate the mobilization of to dna damage site with recruitment in well under a second at the site be require for efficient recruitment of poly polymerase to a dna break site and for efficient repair of dsbs protein start to appear at dsbs in less than a second with half maximum accumulation within second after the damage occur this then allow half maximum recruitment of the dna repair enzyme within second and within second and carry out early step of the hrr pathway the phosphorylated form of be also involve in early step of dsb repair the histone variant constitute about of the histone in human chromatin phosphorylated on serine can be detect as soon a second after irradiation of cell with dna break formation and half maximum accumulation of occurs in one minute the extent of chromatin with phosphorylated be about two million base pair at the site of a dna break do not itself cause chromatin decondensation but within second of irradiation protein can be detect in association with mediates extensive chromatin decondensation through it subsequent interaction with a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex nurd for dna after rapid chromatin remodel cell cycle checkpoint may be activate to allow dna repair to be complete before the cell cycle progress first two kinase atm and atr be activate within or minute after dna be damage this be follow by phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein initiate it function about minute after dna be damage the dna damage do not occur randomly in the genome in mouse embryonic fibroblasts a to enrichment of be find in genetic control region include promoter region and region compare to level find

among hundred of gene whose expression level be affect by hypoxia those with newly acquire promoter be upregulated and those gene whose promoter lose be almost all downregulated a review by wang et oxidize guanine appear to have multiple regulatory role in gene expression in particular when oxidative stress produce in the promoter of a gene the oxidative stress may also inactivate an enzyme that target and normally initiate repair of damage the inactive which no longer excise nevertheless target and complex with and cause a sharp bend in the dna this allow the assembly of a transcriptional

initiation of dna demethylation at a cpg site in adult somatic cell dna methylation typically occur in the context of cpg dinucleotides cpg site form or reactive oxygen specie ros may attack guanine

methylation of dna likely control by of cpg site in gene promoter within neuron dna have be establish a central to memory formation of break in memory exposure of mouse to physiological learning

of the hippocampus brain region similarly expose mouse to contextual fear condition produce a memory also cause dsbs in the hippocampus within minute these neuronal dsbs be restrict to only loci in the neuron genome and these locus be also enrich for the early response gene include fo fosb and in neuron activation these neural dna break be generate by a type ii topoisomerase an inhibitor of nhej dsb repair likely inhibit repair of such break prevents memory formation most damage can be repair without trigger the damage response system however more complex damage activate atr and atm key protein kinases in the damage response system dna damage inhibits which be a key component of progression into mitosis in all eukaryotic cell atr and atm be protein kinase that detect dna damage they bind to dna damage site and activate and in animal cell together these protein make up the dna damage response system some dna damage do not require the recruitment of atr and atm it be only difficult and extensive damage that require atr and atm atm and atr be require for nhej hr icl repair and ner as well a replication fork stability during unperturbed dna replication and in response to replication block atr be recruit for different form of damage such a nucleotide damage stall replication fork and double strand break atm be specifically for the damage response to double strand break the mrn complex compose of and form immediately at the site of double strand break this mrn complex recruit atm to the site of damage atr and atm phosphorylate various protein that contribute to the damage repair system the binding of atr and atm to damage site on dna lead to the recruitment of and these protein kinases send damage signal to the cell cycle control system to delay the progression of the cell cycle lead to the production of dna repair enzymes lead to reversible cell cycle arrest as well a can activate which lead to permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis when there be too much damage apoptosis be trigger in order to protect the organism from potentially harmful also know a a tumor suppressor gene be a major regulatory protein in the dna damage response system which bind directly to the promoter of it target gene act primarily at the checkpoint control the to s transition where it block cell cycle progression activation of can trigger cell death or permanent cell cycle arrest can also activate certain repair pathway such be ner of in the absence of dna damage be regulate by and constantly degrade when there be dna damage be phosphorylated most likely cause by

level of serf a transcription factor for bax and serve a a transcription factor for both bax a proapoptotic protein as well a a cdk inhibitor cdk inhibitor result in cell cycle arrest arrest the cell provide the cell time to repair the damage and if the damage be irreparable recruit bax to trigger apoptosis ddr and role in cancer be a major key player in the growth of cancerous cell damage dna cell with mutate be at a high risk of become cancerous common chemotherapy treatment be genotoxic these treatment be ineffective in cancer tumor that have mutate since they do not have a functioning to either arrest or kill the damage cell one indication that dna damage be a major problem for life be that dna repair process to cope with dna damage have be find in all cellular organism in which dna repair have be investigate for example in bacteria a regulatory network aim at repair dna damage call the so response in escherichia coli have be find in many bacterial specie coli reca a key enzyme in the so response pathway be the define member of a ubiquitous class of dna protein that be essential for homologous recombination a pathway that maintain genomic integrity by repair broken dna gene homologous to reca and to other central gene in the so response pathway be find in almost all the bacterial genome sequence to date cover a large number of phylum suggest both an ancient origin and a widespread occurrence of recombinational repair of dna damage eukaryotic recombinases that be homologues of reca be also widespread in eukaryotic organism for example in fission yeast and human reca homologues promote exchange need for repair of many type of dna lesion another indication that dna damage be a major problem for life be that cell make large investment in dna repair process as point out by hoeijmakers repair just one break could require more than atp molecule a use in signal the presence of the damage the generation of repair focus and the formation in human of the nucleofilament an intermediate in homologous recombinational repair be a homologue of bacterial reca if the structural modification occur during the phase of dna replication the checkpoint arrest or postpone the furtherance of the cell cycle before the product enter the s phase differentiate somatic cell of adult mammal generally replicate infrequently or not at all such cell include for example brain neuron and muscle myocytes have little or no cell turnover cell do not generally generate mutation due to dna error of replication these cell do not commonly give rise to cancer but they do accumulate dna damage with time that likely contribute to age in a cell a break or other type of damage in the transcribed strand of dna can block rna polymerase transcription this would interfere with the synthesis of the protein cod for by the gene in which the blockage occur brasnjevic et al summarize the evidence show that break accumulate with age in the brain though accumulation differ in different region of the brain and that break be the most frequent dna damage in the brain a discuss above these accumulate break would be expect to block transcription of gene consistent with this a review by hetman et gene be identify and show to have reduce transcription in the brain of individual old than year compare to transcription in the brain of those less than year old when particular protein be evaluate in a muscle of rat the majority of the protein show significant decrease during age from month mature rat to month age rat of age another type of dna damage the break be show to cause cell death loss of cell through apoptosis this type of dna damage would not accumulate with age since once a cell be lose through apoptosis it damage would be lose with it thus damage dna segment undermine the dna replication machinery because these altered sequence of dna can not be utilize a true template to produce copy of one genetic material when dna be damage the cell respond in various way to fix the damage and minimize the effect on the cell one such response specifically in eukaryotic cell be to delay cell cell become arrest for some time in the phase before progress through the rest of the cell cycle various study have be conduct to elucidate the purpose of this arrest that be induce by dna damage researcher have find that cell that be prematurely force out of the delay have low cell viability and high rate of damage chromosome compare with cell that be able to undergo a full arrest suggest that the purpose of the delay be to give the cell time to repair damaged chromosome before continue with the cell cycle this ensure the proper functioning of mitosis various specie of animal exhibit similar mechanism of cellular delay in response to dna damage which can be cause by exposure to the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae have specifically be study because progression through the cell cycle can be follow via nuclear morphology with ease by study saccharomyces cerevisiae researcher have be able to learn more about rad gene and the effect that rad mutation may have on the typical cellular dna delay response specifically the gene play a crucial role in detect dna damage and arrest the cell in until the damage be repair through extensive experiment researcher have be able to illuminate the role that the rad gene play in delay cell division in response to dna damage when grow cell be expose to various level of over a give time frame and then analyze with a microcolony assay difference in the cell cycle response can be observe base on which gene be mutate in the cell for instance while unirradiated cell will progress normally through the cell cycle cell that be expose to either permanently arrest become inviable or delay in the phase before continue to divide in mitosis far corroborate the idea that the delay be crucial for dna repair however rad strain which be deficient in dna repair exhibit a markedly different response for instance cell which can not repair dna break tend to permanently arrest in when expose to even very low level of and rarely end up progress through the late stage of the cell cycle this be because the cell can not repair dna damage and thus do not enter mitosis various other rad mutant exhibit similar response when expose to however the strain exhibit an entirely different effect these cell fail to delay in the phase when expose to and end up progress through the cell cycle unperturbed before die this suggest that the gene unlike the other rad gene play a crucial role in initiate arrest to further investigate these finding the cell cycle of double mutant strain have be analyze a mutant be both defective in dna repair and to undergo cell cycle arrest when expose to this suggest that even if dna damage can not be repair if be not present the cell cycle will not delay thus unrepaired dna damage be the signal that tell to halt division and arrest the cell cycle in furthermore there be a response a the level of subsequent dna more cell regardless of the mutation they have become arrest in another and perhaps more helpful way to visualize this effect be to look at photomicroscopy slide initially slide of and haploid cell in the exponential phase of growth show simple single cell that be indistinguishable from each other however the slide look much different after be expose to for hour the slide now show cell exist primarily a microcolonies suggest that cell division have be arrest in contrast the slide show the cell exist primarily a to bud colony and they appear small than the cell this be further evidence that the mutant rad cell continue to divide and be deficient in arrest however there be evidence that although the gene be necessary to induce arrest in response to dna damage give the cell time to repair the damage it do not actually play a direct role in repair dna when cell be artificially arrest in with mbc a microtubule poison that prevent cellular division and then treat with the cell be able to repair their dna and eventually progress through the cell cycle divide into viable cell thus the gene play no role in actually repair damage simply sense damage dna and responds by delay cell division the delay then be mediate by a control mechanism rather than the physical damage dna on the other hand it be possible that there be backup mechanism that fill the role of when it be not present in fact some study have find that do indeed play a critical role in dna repair in one study mutant and normal cell in the exponential phase of growth be expose to and synchronize in specific phase of the cell cycle after be incubate to permit dna repair the extent of pyrimidine dimerization which be indicative of dna damage be assess use sensitive primer extension technique it be find that the removal of dna photolesions be much less efficient in mutant cell than normal cell provide evidence that be involve in dna repair thus the role of in repair dna damage remain unclear regardless it be clear that be necessary to sense dna damage and halt cell division have be suggest to possess to exonuclease activity which be perhaps why it play a role in detect dna damage when dna be damage it be hypothesize that form a complex with and and this complex be recruit to site of dna damage it be in this way that be able to exert it effect although the function of have primarily be study in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae many of the cell cycle control mechanism be similar between specie thus we can conclude that likely play a critical role in the dna damage response in human a well,DNA damage (naturally occurring),Branches of biology,Cell biology

symmetry in quantum mechanic describe feature of spacetime and particle which be unchanged under some transformation in the context of quantum mechanic relativistic quantum mechanic and quantum field theory and with application in the mathematical formulation of the standard model and condensed matter physic in general symmetry in physic invariance and conservation law be fundamentally important constraint for formulate physical theory and model in practice they be powerful method for solve problem and predict what can happen while conservation law do not always give the answer to the problem directly they form the correct constraint and the first step to solve a multitude of problem this article outline the connection between the classical form of continuous symmetry as well a their quantum operator and relate them to the lie group and relativistic transformation in the lorentz group and poincaré group the notational convention use in this article be a follow boldface indicate vector four vector matrix and vectorial operator while quantum state use notation wide hat be for operator narrow hat be for unit vector include their component in tensor index notation the summation convention on the repeat tensor index be use unless state otherwise the minkowski metric signature be generally the correspondence between continuous symmetry and conservation law be give by noether theorem the form of the fundamental quantum operator for example energy a a partial time derivative and momentum a a spatial gradient becomes clear when one consider the initial state then change one parameter of it slightly this can be do for displacement lengths duration time and angle rotation additionally the invariance of certain quantity can be see by make such change in length and angle which illustrate conservation of these quantity in what follow transformation on only wavefunctions in the form be consider where denote a unitary operator unitarity be generally require for operator represent transformation of space time and spin since the norm of a state represent the total probability of find the particle somewhere with some spin must be invariant under these transformation the inverse be the hermitian conjugate the result can be extend to wavefunctions write in dirac notation a standard the transformation on quantum state vector be now the action of change ψ t to ψ t so the inverse change ψ t back to ψ t so an operator invariant under satisfies and thus for any state ψ quantum operator represent observables be also require to be hermitian so that their eigenvalue be real number the operator equal it hermitian conjugate of lie group follow be the key point of group theory relevant to quantum theory example be give throughout the article for an alternative approach use matrix group see the book of hall let g be a lie group which be a group that locally be parameterized by a finite number n of real continuously vary parameter ξ ξ ξ in more mathematical language this mean that g be a smooth manifold that be also a group for which the group operation be smooth dimension of the group n be the number of parameter it have group element g in g be function of the parameter and all parameter set to zero return the identity element of the group group element be often matrix which act on vector or transformation act on function generator of the group be the partial derivative of the group elements with respect to the group parameter with the result evaluate when the parameter be set to zero in the language of manifold the generator be the element of the tangent space to g at the identity the generator be also know a infinitesimal group element or a the element of the lie algebra of g see the discussion below of the commutator one aspect of generator in theoretical physic be they can be construct themselves a operator correspond to symmetry which may be write a matrix or a differential operator in quantum theory for unitary representation of the group the generator require a factor of i the generator of the group form a vector space which mean linear combination of generator also form a generator generator whether matrix or differential operator satisfy the commutation relation where fabc be the basis dependent structure constant of the group this make together with the vector space property the set of all generator of a group a lie algebra due to the antisymmetry of the bracket the structure constant of the group be antisymmetric in the first two index representation of the group then describe the way that the group g or it lie algebra can act on a vector space the vector space might be for example the space of eigenvectors for a hamiltonian have g a it symmetry group we denote the representation use a capital d one can then differentiate d to obtain a representation of the lie algebra often also denote by d these two representation be relate a follow summation on the repeated index j representation be linear operator that take in group element and preserve the composition rule a representation which can not be decompose into a direct sum of other representation be call irreducible it be conventional to label irreducible representation by a superscripted number n in bracket a in d n or if there be more than one number we write d n m there be an additional subtlety that arise in quantum theory where two vector that differ by multiplication by a scalar represent the same physical state here the pertinent notion of representation be a projective representation one that only satisfy the composition law up to a scalar in the context of quantum mechanical spin such representation be call spinorial and energy a generator of translation and time evolution and the space translation operator act on a wavefunction to shift the space coordinate by an infinitesimal displacement δ the explicit expression can be quickly determine by a taylor expansion of ψ δ t about then keep the first order term and neglecting second and high order term replace the space derivative by the momentum operator similarly for the time translation operator act on the time parameter the taylor expansion of ψ t δ t be about t and the time derivative replace by the energy operator name translation operator time operator action on wavefunction infinitesimal operator finite operator generator momentum operator energy operator the exponential function arise by definition a those limit due to euler and can be understand physically and mathematically a follow a net translation can be compose of many small translation so to obtain the translation operator for a finite increment replace δ by δ n and δ t by δ t n where n be a positive integer then a n increase the magnitude of δ and δ t become even small while leave the direction unchanged act the infinitesimal operator on the wavefunction n time and take the limit a n tends to infinity give the finite operator space and time translation commute which mean the operator and generator commute operator generator for a hamiltonian energy be conserve in time and quantum state be stationary state the eigenstates of the hamiltonian be the energy eigenvalue e and all stationary state have the form where t be the initial time usually set to zero since there be no loss of continuity when the initial time be set an alternative notation be momentum a the generator of angular the rotation operator act on a wavefunction to rotate the spatial coordinate of a particle by a constant angle δ θ where be the rotated coordinate about an axis define by a unit vector through an angular increment δ θ give by where be a rotation matrix dependent on the axis and angle in group theoretic language the rotation matrix be group element and the angle and axis be the parameter of the special orthogonal group so the rotation matrix about the standard cartesian basis vector through angle and the corresponding generator of rotation be more generally for rotation about an axis define by the rotation matrix element be where δij be the kronecker delta and εijk be the symbol it be not as obvious how to determine the rotational operator compare to space and time translation we may consider a special case rotation about the x y or z then infer the general result or use the general rotation matrix directly and tensor index notation with δij and εijk to derive the infinitesimal rotation operator which correspond to small δ θ we use the small angle approximation sin δ θ δ θ and cos δ θ then taylor expand about or ri keep the first order term and substitute the angular momentum operator component rotation about rotation about action on wavefunction infinitesimal operator infinitesimal rotation same finite rotation same generator z of the angular momentum operator full angular momentum operator the z of angular momentum can be replace by the component along the axis define by use the dot product again a finite rotation can be make from lot of small rotation replace δ θ by and take the limit a n tends to infinity give the rotation operator for a finite rotation rotation about the same axis do commute for example a rotation through angle θ and θ about axis i can be write however rotation about different ax do not commute the general commutation rule be summarize by in this sense orbital angular momentum have the common sense property of rotation each of the above commutator can be easily demonstrate by hold an everyday object and rotate it through the same angle about any two different ax in both possible ordering the final configuration be different in quantum mechanic there be another form of rotation which mathematically appear similar to the orbital case but have different property describe next angular all previous quantity have classical definition spin be a quantity possess by particle in quantum mechanic without any classical analogue have the unit of angular momentum the spin vector operator be denote the eigenvalue of it component be the possible outcome in unit of of a measurement of the spin project onto one of the basis direction rotation of ordinary space about an axis through angle θ about the unit vector in space act on a multicomponent wave function spinor at a point in space be represent by however unlike orbital angular momentum in which the z quantum number can only take positive or negative integer value include zero the z spin quantum number s can take all positive and negative value there be rotational matrix for each spin quantum number evaluate the exponential for a give z spin quantum number s give a s spin matrix this can be use to define a spinor a a column vector of s component which transform to a rotate coordinate system accord to the spin matrix at a fixed point in space for the simple case of s the spin operator be give by where the pauli matrix in the standard representation be angular the total angular momentum operator be the sum of the orbital and spin and be an important quantity for system especially in nuclear physic and the quantum chemistry of atom and molecule we have a similar rotation matrix quantity in the quantum harmonic the dynamical symmetry group of the n dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator be the special unitary group su n a an example the number of infinitesimal generator of the corresponding lie algebra of su and su be three and eight respectively this lead to exactly three and eight independent conserve quantity other than the hamiltonian in these system the two dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator have the expect conserved quantity of the hamiltonian and the angular momentum but have additional hidden conserve quantity of energy level difference and another form of angular momentum follow be an overview of the lorentz group a treatment of boost and rotation in spacetime throughout this section see for example ohlsson and abers lorentz transformation can be parametrized by rapidity for a boost in the direction of a unit vector and a rotation angle about a unit vector define an axis so and be together six parameter of the lorentz group three for rotation and three for boost the lorentz group be rotation in the rotation matrix and rotation generator consider above form the spacelike part of a matrix represent lorentz transformation three of the lorentz group element and generator for pure

generator of the lorentz group the boost matrix act on any four vector a a a a and mix the and the component accord to the term boost refers to the relative velocity between two frame and be not to be conflate with momentum a the generator of translation a explain below boost and product of rotation give another rotation a frequent exemplification of a subgroup while product of boost and boost or of rotation and boost can not be express a pure boost or pure rotation in general any lorentz transformation can be express a a product of a pure rotation and a pure boost for more background see for example durney and berk et al and reference therein the boost and rotation generator have representation denote and respectively the capital in this context indicate a group representation for the lorentz group the representation and of the generator and fulfill the following commutation rule pure rotation pure boost lorentz transformation generator representation in all commutator the boost entity mixed with those for rotation although rotation alone simply give another rotation exponentiating the generator give the boost and rotation operator which combine into the general lorentz transformation under which the spacetime coordinate transform from one rest frame to another boost rotating frame likewise exponentiating the representation of the generator give the representation of the boost and rotation operator under which a particle spinor field transforms law pure boost pure rotation lorentz transformation transformation representation in the literature the boost generator and rotation generator be sometimes combine into one generator for lorentz transformation an antisymmetric matrix with entry and correspondingly the boost and rotation parameter be collect into another antisymmetric matrix with entry the general lorentz transformation be then with summation over repeat matrix index α and β the λ matrix act on any four vector a a a a and mix the and the component accord to of spinor wavefunctions in relativistic quantum in relativistic quantum mechanic wavefunctions be no longer scalar field but now s component spinor field where s be the spin of the particle the transformation of these function in spacetime be give below under a proper orthochronous lorentz transformation in minkowski space all quantum state locally transform under some representation of the lorentz group where be a representation in other word a dimensional square matrix and be think of a a column vector contain component with the allowed value of irreducible representation and the irreducible representation of and in short irreps can be use to build to spin representation of the lorentz group define new operator so and be simply complex conjugate of each other it follow they satisfy the symmetrically form commutator and these be essentially the commutator the orbital and spin angular momentum operator satisfy therefore and form operator algebras analogous to angular momentum same ladder operator z independently of each other a each of their component mutually commute by the analogy to the spin quantum number we can introduce positive integer or half integer with correspond set of value and the matrix satisfy the above commutation relation be the same a for spin a and b have component give by multiply kronecker delta value with angular

square matrices the integer or m and n numerate all the irreducible representation by in equivalent notation use by author which be each square matrix apply this to particle with spin spinors transform under the real irreps spinors transform under the real irreps direct sum symbolize by see direct sum of matrix for the simpler matrix concept one obtain the representation under which spinors transform where these be also real irreps but a show above they split into complex conjugate in these case the refers to any of or a full lorentz transformation wave in the context of the dirac equation and weyl equation the weyl spinors satisfy the weyl equation transform under the simple irreducible spin representation of the lorentz group since the spin quantum number in this case be the small number allow the weyl spinor transforms under and the weyl spinor transforms under dirac spinors satisfy the dirac equation transform under the representation the direct sum of the irreps for the weyl spinors space translation time translation rotation and boost all take together constitute the poincaré group the group element be the three rotation matrix and three boost matrix a in the lorentz group and one for time translation and three for space translation in spacetime there be a generator for each therefore the poincaré group be in special relativity space and time can be collect into a vector and in parallel so can energy and momentum which combine into a vector with relativistic quantum mechanic in mind the time duration and spatial displacement parameter four in total one for time and three for space combine into a spacetime displacement and the energy and momentum operator be insert in the to obtain a operator which be the generator of spacetime translation four in total one time and three space there be commutation relation between the component generator of spacetime translation and angular momentum generator of lorentz transformation that define the poincaré algebra where η be the minkowski metric tensor it be common to drop any hat for the operator in the commutation relation these equation be an expression of the fundamental property of space and time as far a they be know today they have a classical counterpart where the commutator be replace by poisson bracket to describe spin in relativistic quantum mechanic the pseudovector a casimir operator be the constant spin contribution to the total angular momentum and there be commutation relation between and and between and invariant construct from instance of casimir invariant can be use to classify irreducible representation of the lorentz group group in quantum field group theory be an abstract way of mathematically analyze symmetry unitary operator be paramount to quantum theory so unitary group be important in particle physic the group of n dimensional unitary square matrix be denote u n unitary operator preserve inner product which mean probability be also preserve so the quantum mechanic of the system be invariant under unitary transformation let be a unitary operator so the inverse be the hermitian adjoint which commute with the hamiltonian then the observable corresponding to the operator be conserve and the hamiltonian be invariant under the transformation since the prediction of quantum mechanic should be invariant under the action of a group physicists look for unitary transformation to represent the group important subgroup of each u n be those unitary matrix which have unit determinant or be unimodular these be call the special unitary group and be denote su n the simple unitary group be u which be just the complex number of modulus this matrix entry be of the form in which θ be the parameter of the group and the group be abelian since matrix always commute under matrix multiplication lagrangians in quantum field theory for complex scalar field be often invariant under u transformation if there be a quantum number a associate with the u symmetry for example baryon and the three lepton number in electromagnetic interaction we have and su the general form of an element of a u element be parametrized by two complex number a and b and for su the determinant be restrict to in group theoretic language the pauli matrix be the generator of the special unitary group in two dimension denote su their commutation relation be the same a for orbital angular momentum aside from a factor of a group element of su can be write where σj be a pauli matrix and the group parameter be the angle turn through about an axis the isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator have symmetry group su while the symmetry algebra of the rational anisotropic qho be a nonlinear extension of u and su the eight matrix see article for them and the structure

transformation symmetry symmetry break a lie superalgebra be an algebra in which suitable basis element either have a commutation relation or have an anticommutation relation symmetry have be propose to the effect that all fermionic particle have bosonic analogue and vice versa these symmetry have theoretical appeal in that no extra assumption such a existence of string bar symmetry be make in addition by assume supersymmetry a number of puzzle issue can be resolve these symmetry which be represent by lie superalgebras have not be confirm experimentally it be now believe that they be broken symmetry if they exist but it have be speculate that dark matter be constitute gravitinos a spin particle with mass it supersymmetric partner be the graviton the concept of symmetry be derive from a fundamental postulate of quantum statistic which state that no observable physical quantity should change after exchange two identical particle it state that because all observables be proportional to for a system of identical particle the wave function must either remain the same or change sign upon such an exchange because the exchange of two identical particle be mathematically equivalent to the rotation of each particle by degree and so to the rotation of one particle frame by degrees the symmetric nature of the wave function depend on the particle spin after the rotation operator be apply

in physic center of mass refers to the mathematical and physical concept that define the center of mass of a system of particle in relativistic mechanic and relativistic quantum mechanic in physic there be a unique and well defined notion of the center of mass vector a vector abbreviate of an isolated system of massive particle inside the of inertial frame of galilei spacetime however no such notion exists in special relativity inside the of the inertial frame of minkowski spacetime in any rigidly rotating frame include the special case of a galilean inertial frame with coordinate the newton center of mass of n particle of mass and be the both for free and interacting particle in a special relativistic inertial frame in minkowski spacetime with four vector coordinate a collective variable with all the property of the newton center of mass do not exist the primary property of the center of mass be i together with the total momentum it form a canonical pair ii it transform under rotation a a three vector and iii it be a position associate with the spatial mass distribution of the constituent it be interest that the following three proposal for a relativistic center of mass appear in the literature of the last century take on individually these three property the center of spin or canonical center of mass it be the classical counterpart of the quantum position operator it be a satisfy the same canonical condition a the newton center of mass namely have vanish poisson bracket in phase space however there be no have it a the space part so that it do not identify a worldline but only a depending on the choose inertial frame the center of inertia it be the space part of a so that it identify a worldline but it be not canonical the møller center of energy define a the newton center of mass with the rest mass of the particle replace by their relativistic energy this be not canonical neither the space part of a it only identify a these three collective variable have all the same constant and all of them collapse into the newton center of mass in the limit in the there be a big debate on this problem without any final conclusion in mechanic the phase space expression of the ten generator of the galilei group of an isolated system of n particle with and mass in the inertial frame with coordinate be be an potential they be constant of the motion generate the transformation connect the inertial frame therefore at a definition of the newton center of mass be in special relativity the inertial frame be connect by transformation generate by the poincaré group the form of it ten generator for an isolated system of n particle with interaction be very complicated depends on how the particle be parametrized in phase space and be know explicitly only for certain class of interaction however the ten quantity be constant of the motion and when be a one can define the two casimir invariant of the give representation of the poincaré group these two constant of motion identify the invariant mass and the rest spin of the isolated particle system the relativistic relation be where be the zeroth component of the four momentum the total relativistic energy of the system of particle and the pseudovector be it can be show that in an inertial frame with coordinate the previous three collective variable and be the only one which can be express only in term of and with at since the poincaré generator depend on all the component of the isolated system even when they be at large distance this result show that the relativistic collective variable be global not locally define quantity therefore all of them be quantity at least with local measurement this suggest that there could be problem also with the measurement of the newton center of mass with local method the inertial rest frame of an isolated system can be geometrically define a the inertial frame whose be orthogonal to the conserved of the system they differ only for the choice of the inertial observer origin of the one choose the center of inertia a origin since it be a so that it be the only collective variable which can be use for an inertial observer if be the proper time of the atomic clock carry by the inertial observer and the in the rest spacetime location within these can be describe in an arbitrary inertial frame with the embeddings where the and the three be the column of the wigner boost for orbit of the poincaré group a a consequence the define wigner which transform under wigner rotation when one do a lorentz transformation therefore due to this these privilege rest name wigner can be show to be intrinsically define and do not depend on the inertial observer describe them they allow the description of relativistic bound state without the presence of the relative time of their constituent whose excitation have never be observe in spectroscopy in this framework it be possible to describe the three collective variable with such that it can be show that they have the following expression in term of the jacobi data at for the canonical center of mass and the location in the privileged rest wigner of the canonical center of mass and of the center of energy be and the of the canonical center of mass be always nearer to the center of inertia than the center of energy møller have show that if in an arbitrary inertial frame one draw all the of and associate with every possible inertial frame then they fill a around the with a transverse invariant møller radius determine by the two casimirs of the isolated system this describe the region of of the relativistic collective variable and put a theoretical limit for the localization of relativistic particle this can be see by take the difference between and either or in both case the difference have only a spatial component perpendicular to both and and a magnitude range from zero to the møller radius a the of the isolated particle system in the arbitrary inertial frame range from towards since the difference have only spatial component it be evident that the volume correspond to a around the since the møller radius be of the order of the compton wavelength of the isolated system it be impossible to explore it interior without produce pair namely without take into account relativistic quantum mechanic moreover the be the remnant of the energy condition of general relativity in the flat minkowski solution if a material body have it material radius le that it møller radius then in some reference frame the energy density of the body be not definite positive even if the total energy be positive the difference among the three relativistic collective variable and the be global not locally define effect induce by the lorentz signature of minkowski spacetime and

in quantum mechanic a operator be define a an operator which shift particle and field by a certain amount in a certain direction more specifically for any displacement vector there be a corresponding translation operator that shift particle and field by the amount for example if act on a particle locate at position the result be a particle at position translation operator be unitary translation operator be closely relate to the momentum operator for example a translation operator that move by an infinitesimal amount in the direction have a simple relationship to the of the momentum operator because of this relationship conservation of momentum hold when the translation operator commute with the hamiltonian when law of physic be this be an example of noether theorem the translation operator move particle and field by the amount therefore if a particle be in an eigenstate of the position operator precisely locate at the position then after act on it the particle be at the position an alternative and equivalent way to describe what the translation operator determines be base on wavefunctions if a particle have a wavefunction and act on the particle the new wavefunction be define by this relation be easy to remember a which can be read a the value of the new wavefunction at the new point equal the value of the old wavefunction at the old point here be an example show that these two description be equivalent the state corresponds to the wavefunction where be the dirac delta function while the state corresponds to the wavefunction these indeed satisfy in introductory physic momentum be usually define a mass time velocity however there be a more fundamental way to define momentum in term of translation operator this be more specifically call canonical momentum and it be usually but not always equal to mass time velocity one counterexample be a charged particle in a magnetic field this definition of momentum be especially important because the law of conservation of momentum applies only to canonical momentum and be not universally valid if momentum be define instead a mass time velocity the kinetic momentum for reason explain below the canonical momentum operator be define a the gradient of the translation operator near the origin where be the reduced planck constant for example what be the result when the operator act on a quantum state to find the answer translate the state by an infinitesimal amount in the and calculate the rate that the state be change and multiply it by for example if a state do not change at all when it be translate in the then it of momentum be more explicitly be a vector operator a vector consisting of three operator define by where be the identity operator and be the unit vector in the be define analogously the equation above be the most general definition of in the special case of a single particle with wavefunction can be write in a more specific and useful form in one dimension or in three dimension a an operator act on wavefunctions this be the familiar expression for but we have derive it here from a more basic start point we have now define in term of translation operator it be also possible to write a translation operator a a function of the method consist in express a give translation a a huge number of consecutive tiny translation and then use the fact that infinitesimal translation can be write in term of which give the final expression where be the operator exponential and the side be the taylor series expansion for very small one can use the approximation hence the operator be refer to a the of translation a nice way to that these relation be correct be to do a taylor expansion of the translation operator act on a wavefunction expand the exponential to all order the translation operator generate exactly the full taylor expansion of a test function so every translation operator generate exactly the expect translation on a test function if the function be analytic in some domain of the complex plane in other word if particle and field be move by the amount and then by the amount overall they have be move by the amount for a mathematical proof one can look at what these operator do to a particle in a position eigenstate since the operator and have the same effect on every state in an eigenbasis it follow that the operator be equal the translation operator be invertible and their inverse be this follow from the successive translation property above and the fact that a translation by a distance of be the same a the identity operator which leave all state unchanged operator commute with each because both side be equal to operator be if and be two wavefunctions then the inner product of with be while the inner product of with be by change of variable these two inner product be exactly the same therefore the translation operator be unitary and in particular the fact that translation operator be unitary implies that the momentum operator be hermitian operate on a a translation operator operate on a bra in the position eigenbasis give proof it adjoint expression be use the result above replace by a translation into it accord to the successive translation property above a translation by the vector can be write a the product of translation in the component direction where be unit vector with position suppose be an eigenvector of the position operator with eigenvalue we have while therefore the commutator between a translation operator and the position operator be this can also be write use the above property a where be the identity operator with momentum since translation operator all commute with each other see above and since each component of the momentum operator be a sum of two scaled translation operator it follow that translation operator all commute with the momentum operator this commutation with the momentum operator hold true generally even if the system be not isolate where energy or momentum may not be conserve the set of translation operator for all with the operation of multiplication define a the result of successive translation function composition satisfies all the axiom of a group when you do two translation consecutively the result be a single different translation see successive translation property above of identity a translation by the vector be the identity operator the operator that have no effect on anything it function a the identity element of the group element have an inverse a proven above any translation operator be the inverse of the reverse translation this be the claim that it be true by definition a be the case for any group base on function composition therefore the set of translation operator for all form a group since there be continuously infinite number of element the group be a continuous group moreover the translation operator commute among themselves the product of two translation a translation follow by another do not depend on their order therefore the translation group be an abelian group the translation group act on the hilbert space of position eigenstates be isomorphic to the group of vector addition in the euclidean space consider a single particle in one dimension unlike classical mechanic in quantum mechanic a particle neither have a well defined position nor a well define momentum in the quantum formulation the expectation value play the role of the classical variable for example if a particle be in a state then the expectation value of the position be where be the position operator if a translation operator act on the state create a new state then the expectation value of position for be equal to the expectation value of position for plus the vector this result be consistent with what you would expect from an operation that shift the particle by that amount proof that a translation operator change the expectation value of position in the way you would expect assume a state above use the normalization condition and the commutator result prove in a previous section on the other hand when the translation operator act on a state the expectation value of the momentum be not change this can be prove in a similar way a the above but use the fact that translation operator commute with the momentum operator this result be again consistent with expectation translate a particle do not change it velocity or mass so it momentum should not change in quantum mechanic the hamiltonian represent the energy and dynamic of a system let be a newly translate state the argument of be irrelevant here and be temporarily drop for brevity a hamiltonian be say to be invariant if or this imply that thus if the hamiltonian be invariant under translation the hamiltonian commute with the translation operator loosely speak if we translate the system then measure it energy then translate it back it amount to the same thing a just measure it energy directly translational first we consider the case where all the translation operator be symmetry of the system a we will see in this case conservation of momentum occurs for example if be the hamiltonian describe all particle and field in the universe and be the translation operator that shift all particle and field in the universe simultaneously by the same amount then this be always a symmetry describe the complete law of physic in our universe which be independent of location a a consequence conservation of momentum be universally valid on the other hand perhaps and refer to just one particle then the translation operator be exact symmetry only if the particle be alone in a vacuum correspondingly the momentum of a single particle be not usually conserve it change when the particle bump into other object but it be conserve if the particle be alone in a vacuum since the hamiltonian commute with the translation operator when the translation be invariant it also commute with the infinitesimal translation operatorin summary whenever the hamiltonian for a system remain invariant under continuous translation then the system have conservation of momentum meaning that the expectation value of the momentum operator remain constant this be an example of noether theorem translational there be another special case where the hamiltonian may be translationally invariant this type of translational symmetry be observe whenever the potential be periodic in general the hamiltonian be not invariant under any translation represent by with arbitrary where have the property and where be the identity operator see proof above but whenever coincides with the period of the potential since the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian be already invariant under any arbitrary translation be a function of the entire hamiltonian satisfies now the hamiltonian commute with translation operator they can be simultaneously diagonalise therefore the hamiltonian be invariant under such translation which no longer remain continuous the translation become discrete with the period of the potential the ion in a perfect crystal be arrange in a regular periodic array so we be lead to the problem of an electron in a potential with the periodicity of the underlie bravais lattice for all bravais lattice vector however perfect periodicity be an idealisation real solid be never absolutely pure and in the neighbourhood of the impurity atoms the solid be not the same a elsewhere in the crystal moreover the ion be not in fact stationary but continually undergo thermal vibration about their equilibrium position these destroy the perfect translational symmetry of a crystal to deal with this type of problem the main problem be artificially divide in two part a the ideal fictitious perfect crystal in which the potential be genuinely periodic and b the effect on the property of a hypothetical perfect crystal of all deviation from perfect periodicity treat a small perturbation although the problem of electron in a solid be in principle a problem in independent electron approximation each electron be subject to the schrödinger equation with a periodic potential and be know a electron in contrast to free particle to which bloch electron reduce when the periodic potential be identically zero for each bravais lattice vector we define a translation operator which when operate on any function shift the argument by since all translation form an abelian group the result of apply two successive translation do not depend on the order in which they be apply in addition a the hamiltonian be periodic we have hence the for all bravais lattice vector and the hamiltonian form a set of commutate operator therefore the eigenstates of can be choose to be simultaneous eigenstates of all the the eigenvalue of the translation operator be relate because of the condition we have and therefore it follow that now let the be the three primitive vector for the bravais lattice by a suitable choice of we can always write in the form if be a general bravais lattice vector give by it follow then substitute one get where and the be the reciprocal lattice vector satisfy the equation therefore one can choose the simultaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian and so that for every bravais lattice vector so this result be know a bloch theorem translational invariance time evolution of the wave function in the passive transformation picture translational invariance require it follow that where be the unitary time evolution operator when the hamiltonian be time independent if the hamiltonian be time dependent the above commutation relation be satisfied if or commute with for all suppose at two observer a and b prepare identical system at and fig respectively if be the state vector of the system prepare by a then the state vector of the system prepare by b will be give by both the system look identical to the observer who prepare them after time the state vector evolve into and respectively use the commutation relation the later may be write a which be just the translated version of the system prepare by a at time therefore the two system which differ only by a translation at differ only by the same translation at any instant of time the time evolution of both the system appear the same to the observer who prepare them it can be conclude that the translational invariance of hamiltonian implies that the same experiment repeat at two different place will give the same result a see by the local observer wave function operator in quantum mechanic translation symmetry symmetry,Translation operator (quantum

in theoretical physic the field theory be a quantum field theory whose existence be predict by argument in string theory it be still poorly understood because there be no known description of the theory in term of an action functional despite the inherent difficulty in study this theory it be consider to be an interesting object for a variety of reason both physical and mathematical the have prove to be important for study the general property of quantum field theory indeed this theory subsume a large number of mathematically interesting effective quantum field theory and point to new duality relate these theory for example luis alday davide gaiotto and yuji tachikawa show that by compactifying this theory on a surface one obtain a quantum field theory and there be a duality know a the agt correspondence which relate the physic of this theory to certain physical concept associate with the surface itself more recently theorist have extend these idea to study the theory obtain by compactifying down to three dimension in addition to it application in quantum field theory the have spawn a number of important result in pure mathematics for example the existence of the be use by witten to give a physical explanation for a conjectural relationship in mathematics call the geometric langlands correspondence in subsequent work witten show that the could be use to understand a concept in mathematics call khovanov homology develop by mikhail khovanov around khovanov homology provide a tool in knot theory the branch of mathematics that study and classify the different shape of knot another application of the in mathematics be the work of davide gaiotto greg moore and andrew neitzke which use physical idea to derive new result in hyperkähler geometry abjm superconformal field theory n supersymmetric theory,"6D (2,0) superconformal field theory",Subfields of physics,Particle physics

molecular symmetry in physic and chemistry describe the symmetry present in molecule and the classification of molecule accord to their symmetry molecular symmetry be a fundamental concept in the application of quantum mechanic in physic and chemistry for example it can be use to predict or explain many of a molecule property such a it dipole moment and it allow spectroscopic transition base on selection rule without do the exact rigorous calculation which in some case may not even be possible group theory be the predominant framework for analyze molecular symmetry among all the molecular symmetry diatomic molecule show some distinct feature and they be relatively easy to analyze the physical law govern a system be generally write a a relation equations differential equation integral equation an operation on the ingredient of this relation which keep the form of the relation invariant be call a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system these symmetry operation can involve external or internal give rise to geometrical or internal symmetry these symmetry operation can be global or local give rise to global or gauge symmetry these symmetry operation can be discrete or continuous symmetry be a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanic it can predict conserved quantity and provide quantum number it can predict degeneracy of eigenstates and give insight about the matrix element of the hamiltonian without calculate them rather than look into individual symmetry it be sometimes more convenient to look into the general relation between the symmetry it turn out that group theory be the most efficient way of do this group a be a mathematical structure usually denote in the form g consisting of a set and a binary operation sometimes loosely call satisfy the following property for every pair of element the for every and and in both x y z and y z result with the same element in in symbol of identity there must be an element say in such that product any element of with make no change to the element in symbol of inverse for each element in there must be an element in such that product of and be the identity element in symbol for each such that in addition to the above four if it so happen that the operation in then the group be call an abelian group otherwise it be call a group group symmetry and conservation the set of all symmetry transformation of a hamiltonian have the structure of a group with group multiplication equivalent to apply the transformation one after the other the group element can be represent a matrix so that the group operation become the ordinary matrix multiplication in quantum mechanic the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of state be give by unitary operator so each of the element of the symmetry group be unitary operator now any unitary operator can be express a the exponential of some hermitian operator so the corresponding hermitian operator be the of the symmetry group these unitary transformation act on the hamiltonian operator in some hilbert space in a way that the hamiltonian remain invariant under the transformation in other word the symmetry operator commute with the hamiltonian if represent the unitary symmetry operator and act on the hamiltonian then these operator have the property of a group the symmetry operation be close under multiplication application of symmetry transformation be associative there be always a trivial transformation where nothing be do to the original this be the identity element of the group and as long a an inverse transformation exist it be a symmetry transformation it leave the hamiltonian invariant thus the inverse be part of this set so by the symmetry of a system we mean a set of operator each of which commute with the hamiltonian and they form a symmetry group this group may be abelian or depend upon which one it be the property of the system change for example if the group be abelian there would be no degeneracy correspond to every different kind of symmetry in a system we can find a symmetry group associate with it it follow that the generator of the symmetry group also commute with the hamiltonian now it follow that the observable corresponding to the generator hermitian matrix be conserve the derivative of the expectation value of the operator t can be write a now so a h be also hermitian so we have now a state above and if the operator t do not have any explicit be a constant independent of what the state may be so the observable corresponding to the operator t be conserve some specific example can be system have rotational translational invariance etc for a rotationally invariant system the symmetry group of the hamiltonian be the general rotation group now if say the system be invariant about any rotation about the system have axial symmetry then the symmetry group of the hamiltonian be the group of rotation about the symmetry axis now this group be generate by the of the orbital angular momentum general group element thus commute with for this system and of the angular momentum be conserve similarly translation symmetry give rise to conservation of linear momentum inversion symmetry give rise to parity conservation and so on symmetry operation point group and group a molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually have some geometrical symmetry this symmetry be describe by a certain point group which consist of operation call symmetry operation that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that be indistinguishable from the start configuration there be five type of point group symmetry operation identity rotation reflection inversion and improper rotation or common to all symmetry operation be that the geometrical of the molecule do not change it position hence the name point group one can determine the element of the point group for a particular molecule by consider the geometrical symmetry of it molecular model however when one use a point group the element be not to be interpret in the same way instead the element rotate reflect the vibronic coordinate and these element commute with the vibronic hamiltonian the point group be use to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates the symmetry classification of the rotational level the eigenstates of the full rovibronic nuclear spin hamiltonian require the use of the appropriate group a introduce by see the section inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry below and link the element of group commute with the full molecular hamiltonian in addition to point group there exist another kind of group important in crystallography where translation in also need to be take care of they be know a space group basic point group symmetry operation the five basic symmetry operation mention above be operation e from the german meaning unity the identity operation leave the molecule unchanged it form the identity element in the symmetry group though it inclusion seem to be trivial it be important also because even for the most asymmetric molecule this symmetry be present the corresponding symmetry element be the entire molecule itself i operation invert the molecule about it center of inversion if it have any the center of inversion be the symmetry element in this case there may or may not be an atom at this center a molecule may or may not have a center of inversion for example the benzene molecule a cube and sphere do have a center of inversion whereas a tetrahedron do not σ reflection operation produce a mirror image geometry of the molecule about a certain plane the mirror plane bisect the molecule and must include it center of geometry the plane of symmetry be the symmetry element in this case a symmetry plane parallel with the principal axis define below be dubbed vertical σv and one perpendicular to it horizontal σh a third type of symmetry plane exist if a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisect the angle between two rotation ax perpendicular to the principal axis the plane be dub dihedral σd n rotation the rotation operation about a axis of symmetry produce molecular orientation indistinguishable from the initial for each rotation of clockwise and be denote by the axis of symmetry be the symmetry element in this case a molecule can have more than one symmetry axis the one with the high be call the principal axis and by convention be assign the in a cartesian coordinate system n or improper rotation sn the improper rotation operation about an axis of improper rotation be compose of two successive geometry transformation first a rotation through about the axis of that rotation and second reflection through a plane perpendicular and through the molecular center of geometry to that axis this axis be the symmetry element in this case it be abbreviate sn all other symmetry present in a specific molecule be a combination of these operation schoenflies notation the schoenflies or schönflies notation name after the german mathematician arthur moritz schoenflies be one of two convention commonly use to describe point group this notation be use in spectroscopy and be use here to specify a molecular point group there be two point group for diatomic molecule for heteronuclear diatomics and for homonuclear diatomics the group contain rotation through any angle about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflection through the plane contain the axis or the vertical axis that be reason of the subscript the group all plane of symmetry be equivalent so that all reflection form a single class with a continuous series of element the axis of symmetry be bilateral so that there be a continuous series of class each contain two element note that this group be and there exist an infinite number of irreducible representation in the group the character table of the group be a follow e linear function rotation quadratic z rz x y rx ry xz yz xy in addition to axial reflection symmetry homonuclear diatomic molecule be symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane pass through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the symmetry in homonuclear diatomic molecule give rise to symmetry group the class of the group can be obtain from those of the group use the relation between the two group like be and there be an infinite number of irreducible representation in the group the character table of this group be a follow e i linear function rotation quadratic z rz x y rx ry xz yz xy z x y summary example point group symmetry operation or group operation symmetry element or group element simple description of typical geometry group order number of class and irreducible representation irreps example e σv e linear fluoride e σh e linear with inversion center unlike a single atom the hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule do commute with so the quantum number be no longer a good quantum number the internuclear axis choose a specific direction in space and the potential be no longer spherically symmetric instead and commute with the hamiltonian take the arbitrary internuclear axis a the z axis but do not commute with due to the fact that the electronic hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule be invariant under rotation about the internuclear line the z axis but not under rotation about the x or y ax again and act on a different hilbert space so they commute with in this case also the electronic hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule be also invariant under reflection in all plane contain the internuclear line the plane be such a plane and reflection of the coordinate of the electron in this plane correspond to the operation if be the operator that perform this reflection then so the complete set of commute operator csco for a general heteronuclear diatomic molecule be where be an operator that invert only one of the two spatial x or y in the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule there be an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provide by the internuclear axis there be a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei the symmetry discuss in this paragraph only depend on the two nuclear charge be the same the two nucleus can therefore have different mass that be they can be two isotope of the same specie such a the proton and the deuteron or and and so on choose this point a the origin of the coordinate the hamiltonian be invariant under an inversion of the coordinate of all electron with respect to that origin namely in the operation thus the parity operator thus the csco for a homonuclear diatomic molecule be molecular term symbol be a shorthand expression of the group representation and angular momentum that characterize the state of a molecule it be the equivalent of the term symbol for the atomic case we already know the csco of the most general diatomic molecule so the good quantum number can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule here the symmetry be explicitly state in the nomenclature angular momentum here the system be not spherically symmetric so and the state can not be depict in term of a an eigenstate of the hamiltonian be not an eigenstate of anymore in contrast to the atomic term symbol where the state be write as but a the eigenvalue correspond to can still be use if where be the absolute value in of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis can be use a a term symbol by analogy with the spectroscopic notation s p d f use for atom it be customary to associate code letter with the value of accord to the correspondence for the individual electron the notation and the correspondence use be and axial symmetry again and in addition a it follow immediately that if the action of the operator on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue of convert this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue and that both eigenstates have the same energy the electronic term such that that be the term be thus doubly degenerate each value of the energy correspond to two state which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis this twofold degeneracy be actually only approximate and it be possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motion lead to a splitting of the term with into two nearby level which be call corresponds to the state these state be so that the state of a term can only be multiply by a constant in a reflection through a plane contain the molecular axis when simultaneous eigenfunctions of and can be construct since the eigenfunctions of have eigenvalue so to completely specify state of diatomic molecule state which be leave unchanged upon reflection in a plane contain the nucleus need to be distinguish from state for which it change sign in perform that operation inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry homonuclear diatomic molecule have a center of symmetry at their midpoint choose this point a the origin of the coordinate the electronic hamiltonian be invariant under the point group operation i of inversion of the coordinate of all electron at that origin this operation be not the parity operation p or the parity operation involve the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinate at the molecular center of mass electronic state be either even remain unchanged by the operation i or they be odd change in sign by i the former be denote by the subscript g and be call gerade while the latter be denote by the subscript u and be call ungerade the subscript g or u be therefore add to the term symbol so that for homonuclear diatomic molecule we have electronic state a homonuclear diatomic molecule have four electronic state vibronic state be classify accord to the irreducible representation of the appropriate point group the complete hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule a for all molecule commute with the parity operation p or and rovibronic energy level usually call rotational level can be give the parity symmetry label or the complete hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commute with the operation of permute or exchange the coordinate of the two identical nucleus and rotational level gain the additional label s or a depend on whether the total wavefunction be unchanged symmetric or change in sign antisymmetric by the permutation operation thus the rotational level of heteronuclear diatomic molecule be label or whereas those of homonuclear diatomic molecule be label or the rovibronic nuclear spin state be classify use the appropriate group the complete hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule a for all molecule do not commute with the point group inversion operation i because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine hamiltonian the nuclear hyperfine hamiltonian can mix the rotational level of g and u vibronic state call ortho para mixing and give rise to ortho para transition spin and total angular momentum if s denote the resultant of the individual electron spin be the eigenvalue of s and a in the case of atom each electronic term of the molecule be also characterise by the value of s if coupling be neglect there be a degeneracy of order associate with each for a give just a for atom the quantity be call the multiplicity of the term write a a left superscript so that the term symbol be write a for example the symbol denote a term such that and it be worth note that the ground state often label by the symbol of most diatomic molecule be such that and exhibit maximum symmetry thus in most case it be a state write a excited state be write with in front for a heteronuclear molecule and a state write a for a homonuclear molecule couple lift the degeneracy of the electronic state this be because the z of spin interacts with the z of the orbital angular momentum generate a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis this be characterize by the quantum number where again positive and negative value of be degenerate so the pair ml m and ml m be degenerate these pair be group together with the quantum number which be define a the sum of the pair of value ml m for which ml be positive molecular term symbol so the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule be give by where s be the total spin quantum number be the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis be the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis u g be the effect of the point group operation i be the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane contain the internuclear axis effect of symmetry on the matrix element of the hamiltonian the electronic term or potential curve of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance and it be important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curve a r varies it be of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curve represent the different term the rule of von neumann and wigner two potential curve and can not cross if the state and have the same point group symmetry let and two different electronic potential curve if they intersect at some point then the function and will have neighbour value near this point to decide whether such an intersection can occur it be convenient to put the problem a follow suppose at some internuclear distance the value and be close but distinct a show in the figure then it be to be examine whether or and can be make to intersect by the modification the energy and be eigenvalue of the hamiltonian the corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denote by and and be assume to be real the hamiltonian now become where be the small perturbation operator though it be a degenerate case so ordinary method of perturbation wo work set it can be deduce that in order for and to be equal at the point the following two condition be require to be fulfil and a an initial approximation instead of and themselves linear combination of them of the form can be take a the eigenstate of the hamiltonian where and be in general complex substitute this expression in the perturbed schrödinger equation expand take inner product with the respective bra and now and be eigenstates of the hamiltonian corresponding to different eigenvalue and as be itself hermitian they be orthonormal thus and since the operator be hermitian the matrix element and be real while the compatibility condition for these equation be such that both and be not simultaneously zero this give this formula give the required eigenvalue of the energy in the first approximation if the energy value of the two term become equal at the point the term intersect this mean that the two value of give by formula be the same for this to happen the expression under the radical must vanish since it be the sum of two square both be simultaneously zero so it give the condition however we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter give the perturbation hence the two condition involve more than one parameter can not in general be simultaneously satisfy the initial assumption that and real implies that be also real so two case can arise the matrix element vanishes identically it be then possible to satisfy the first condition independently therefore it be possible for the crossing to occur if for a certain value of for a certain value of the first equation be satisfy a the perturbation operator or commute with the symmetry operator of the molecule this case will happen if the two electronic state and have different point group symmetry for example if they correspond to two electronic term have different value of different electronic parity g and u different multiplicity or for example be the two term and a it can be show that for a scalar quantity whose operator commute with the angular momentum and inversion operator only the matrix element for transition between state of the same angular momentum and parity be and the proof remain valid in essentially the same form for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator if the electronic state and have the same point group symmetry then can be and will in general be except for accidental crossing which would occur if by coincidence the two equation be satisfy at the same value of it be in general impossible to find a single value of a single value of for which the two condition be satisfy simultaneously thus in a diatomic molecule only term of different symmetry can intersect while the intersection of term of like symmetry be forbidden this be in general true for any case in quantum mechanic where the hamiltonian contain some parameter and it eigenvalue be consequently function of that parameter this general rule be know a neumann wigner this general symmetry principle have important consequence be molecular spectrum in fact in the application of valence bond method in case of diatomic molecule three main correspondence between the atomic and the molecular orbitals be take care of molecular orbitals have a give value of the component of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis must connect with atomic orbitals have the same value of the same value of the electronic parity of the wave function g or u must be preserve a varies from to the von rule must be obey so that energy curve correspond to orbitals have the same symmetry do not cross a varies from to thus von rule also act a a starting point for valence bond theory symmetry in diatomic molecule manifest itself directly by influence the molecular spectrum of the molecule the effect of symmetry on different type of spectrum in diatomic molecule be rotational spectrum in the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be show to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the electric dipole operator along the molecular axis this be the permanent electric dipole moment in homonuclear diatomic molecule the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there be no pure rotation spectrum heteronuclear diatomic molecule possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra correspond to rotational transition without change in the vibronic state for the selection rule for a rotational transition be for the selection rule become be due to the fact that although the photon absorb or emit carry one unit of angular momentum the nuclear rotation can change with no change in if the electronic angular momentum make an equal and opposite change symmetry consideration require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule be direct along the internuclear line and this lead to the additional selection rule pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consist of line in the far or the microwave region the frequency of these line give by where and in exceptional circumstance the hyperfine hamiltonian can mix the rotational level of g and u vibronic state of homonuclear diatomic molecule give rise to pure rotational ortho para transition in a homonuclear diatomic molecule vibrational spectrum the transition matrix element for pure vibrational transition be where be the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state because the dipole moment depend on the bond length it variation with displacement of the nucleus from equilibrium can be express a where be the dipole moment when the displacement be zero the transition matrix element be therefore use orthogonality of the state so the transition matrix be only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement for otherwise the derivative of would be zero the gross selection rule for the vibrational transition of diatomic molecule be then to show a vibrational spectrum a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that vary with extension so homonuclear diatomic molecule do not undergo vibrational transition so a homonuclear diatomic molecule do show purely vibrational spectrum for small displacement the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expect to vary linearly with the extension of the bond this would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charge on the two atom be independent of the internuclear distance in such case know a harmonic approximation the quadratic and high term in the expansion can be ignore and now the matrix element can be express in position basis in term of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions hermite polynomial use the property of hermite polynomial it be evident that which be proportional to produce two term one proportional to and the other to so the only contribution to come from so the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecule be homonuclear diatomic molecule show no pure vibrational spectral line and the vibrational spectral line of heteronuclear diatomic molecule be govern by the selection rule rovibrational spectrum homonuclear diatomic molecule show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectrum however a the absorption of a photon require the molecule to take up one unit of angular momentum vibrational transition be accompany by a change in rotational state which be subject to the same selection rule a for the pure rotational spectrum for a molecule in a state the transition between two or rovibrational level and with vibrational quantum number and fall into two set accord to whether or the set corresponding to be call the r branch the corresponding frequency be give by the set corresponding to be call the p branch the corresponding frequency be give by both branch make up what be call a band or a rovibrational band these band be in the part of the spectrum if the molecule be not in a state so that transition with be allow this give rise to a further branch of the spectrum call the q branch the frequency correspond to the line in this branch be give by a quadratic function of if and be unequal and reduce to the single frequency if for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule this selection rule have two consequence both the vibrational and rotational quantum number must change the be therefore forbidden the energy change of rotation can be either subtract from or add to the energy change of vibration give the and branch of the spectrum respectively homonuclear diatomic molecule also show this kind of spectrum the selection rule however be a bit different both and diatomic molecule show rovibrational spectrum a be absent in the spectrum of heteronuclear diatomic molecule an explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be show in case of the simplest system a hydrogen molecule ion or a cation a natural trial wave function for the be determine by first consider the state of the system when the two proton be widely separate then there be clearly two possible state the electron be attach either to one of the proton form a hydrogen atom in the ground state or the electron be attach to the other proton again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom a depict in the picture two possible initial state of the system the trial state in the position basis or the function be then and the analysis of use variational method start assume these form again this be only one possible combination of state there can be other combination of state also for example the electron be in an excited state of the hydrogen atom the corresponding hamiltonian of the system be clearly use the state and a basis will introduce element in the hamiltonian here because of the relative simplicity of the ion the matrix element can actually be calculate the electronic hamiltonian of commute with the point group inversion symmetry operation i use it symmetry property we can relate the diagonal and element of the hamiltonian a the diagonal term where be the energy of the hydrogen atom again where the last step follow from the fact that and from the symmetry of the system the value of the integral be same now the term by insert a complete set of state in the last term be call the and a the wave function be real so because as well a the linear combination of and that diagonalize the hamiltonian be after normalization now a i for the state be also eigenstates of i it turn out that and be the eigenstates of i with eigenvalue and in other word the wave function and be gerade symmetric and ungerade unsymmetric respectively the corresponding expectation value of the energy be the energy v separation graph of the two low curve denote the and state respectively high one be the excited state the minimum of corresponds to an energy from the graph we see that only have a minimum corresponding to a separation of å and a total energy which be less than the initial energy of the system thus only the gerade state stabilize the ion with a bind energy of a a result the ground state of be and this state be call a bonding molecular orbital thus symmetry play an explicit role in the formation of

in the theory of lie group lie algebra and their representation theory a algebra extension be an enlargement of a give lie algebra by another lie algebra extension arise in several way there be the extension obtain by take a direct sum of two lie algebra other type be the extension and the extension extension may arise naturally for instance when form a lie algebra from projective group representation such a lie algebra will contain central charge start with a polynomial loop algebra over simple lie algebra and perform two extension a central extension and an extension by a derivation one obtain a lie algebra which be isomorphic with an untwisted affine algebra use the centrally extend loop algebra one may construct a current algebra in two spacetime dimension the virasoro algebra be the universal central extension of the witt algebra central extension be need in physic because the symmetry group of a quantized system usually be a central extension of the classical symmetry group and in the same way the corresponding symmetry lie algebra of the quantum system be in general a central extension of the classical symmetry algebra algebra have be conjecture to be symmetry group of a unified superstring theory the centrally extend lie algebra play a dominant role in quantum field theory particularly in conformal field theory string theory and in a large portion towards the end be devote to background material for application of lie algebra extension both in mathematics and in physic in area where they be actually useful a parenthetical link background material be provide where it might be beneficial due to the lie correspondence the theory and consequently the history of lie algebra extension be tightly link to the theory and history of group extension a systematic study of group extension be perform by the austrian mathematician otto schreier in in his phd thesis and later publish the problem pose for his thesis by otto hölder be give two group and find all group have a normal subgroup isomorphic to such that the factor group be isomorphic to lie algebra extension be most interesting and useful for lie algebra in victor kac and robert moody independently generalize the notion of classical lie algebra result in a new theory of lie algebra now call algebras they generalize the simple lie algebra and can often concretely be construct a extension notational abuse to be find below include for the exponential map give an argument write for the element in a direct product be the identity in and analogously for lie algebra direct sum where also and be use interchangeably likewise for semidirect product and semidirect sum canonical injection both for group and lie algebra be use for implicit identification furthermore if be group then the default name for element of be and their lie algebra be the default name for element of be just like for the group partly to save scarce alphabetical resource but mostly to have a uniform notation lie algebra that be ingredient in an extension will without comment be take to be over the same field the summation convention applies include sometimes when the index involve be both upstairs or both downstairs caveat not all proof and proof outline below have universal validity the main reason be that the lie algebra be often and then there may or may not be a lie group correspond to the lie algebra moreover even if such a group exist it may not have the usual property the exponential map might not exist and if it do it might not have all the usual property in such case it be questionable whether the group should be endow with the lie qualifier the literature be not uniform for the explicit examples the relevant structure be supposedly in place lie algebra extension be formalize in term of short exact sequence a short exact sequence be an exact sequence of length three such that be a monomorphism be an epimorphism and from these property of exact sequence it follow that the image of be an ideal in moreover but it be not necessarily the case that be isomorphic to a subalgebra of this construction mirror the analogous construction in the closely related concept of group extension if the situation in prevails and for lie algebra over the same field then one say that be an extension of by the define property may be reformulate the lie algebra be an extension of by if be exact here the zero on the end represent the zero lie algebra contain the null vector only and the map be the obvious one map to and map all element of to with this definition it follow automatically that be a monomorphism and be an epimorphism an extension of by be not necessarily unique let denote two extension and let the prime below have the obvious interpretation then if there exist a lie algebra isomorphism such that then the extension and be say to be extension equivalence of extension be an equivalence relation a lie algebra extension be if there be a subspace such that and be an ideal in a lie algebra extension be if there be a subspace such that a a vector space and be a subalgebra in an ideal be a subalgebra but a subalgebra be not necessarily an ideal a trivial extension be thus a split extension central extension of a lie algebra by an abelian lie algebra can be obtain with the help of a nontrivial background on occur in the context of projective representation background of lie group this be allude to far down a lie algebra extension be a extension if be contain in the center of property the center commute with everything in this case be abelian a central extension of one may construct a on suppose be a central extension of by let be a linear map from to with the property that be a of use this section to define by the map satisfies to see this use the definition of on the left hand side then use the linearity of use jacobi identity on to get rid of half of the six term use the definition of again on term sit inside three lie bracket bilinearity of lie bracket and the jacobi identity on and then finally use on the three remain term that and that so that bracket to zero with everything it then follow that satisfy the corresponding relation and if in addition be then be a on via a trivial correspondence of with the underlying field a central extension be if for every other central extension there exist unique homomorphism and such that the diagram commute and by universality it be easy to conclude that such universal central extension be unique up to isomorphism direct let be lie algebras over the same field define and define addition pointwise on scalar multiplication be define by with these definition be a vector space over with the lie bracket be a lie algebra define far it be clear that hold a an exact sequence this extension of by be call a extension it be of course nothing else than the lie algebra direct sum by symmetry of definition be an extension of by a well but it be clear from that the subalgebra be an ideal lie algebra this property of the direct sum of lie algebra be promote to the definition of a trivial extension semidirect inspire by the construction of a semidirect product background of group use a homomorphism one can make the corresponding construct for lie algebra if be a lie algebra homomorphism then define a lie bracket on by with this lie bracket the lie algebra so obtain be denote and be call the sum of and by inspection of one see that be a subalgebra of and be an ideal in define by and by it be clear that thus be a lie algebra extension of by a with the trivial extension this property generalize to the definition of a split extension example let be the lorentz group and let denote the translation group in dimension isomorphic to and consider the multiplication rule of the poincaré group where and be identify with their image in from it follow immediately that in the poincaré group thus every lorentz transformation correspond to an automorphism of with inverse and be clearly a homomorphism now define endow with multiplication give by unwind the definition one find that the multiplication be the same a the multiplication one start with and it follow that from follow that and then from it follow that let be a derivation background of and denote by the lie algebra span by define the lie bracket on by it be obvious from the definition of the bracket that be and ideal in in and that be a subalgebra of furthermore be complementary to in let be give by and by it be clear that thus be a split extension of by such an extension be call by a derivation if be define by then be a lie algebra homomorphism into hence this construction be a special case of a semidirect sum for when start from and use the construction in the preceding section the same lie bracket result if be a background on a lie algebra and be any vector space let vector space direct sum and define a lie bracket on by here be an arbitrary but fixed element of antisymmetry follow from antisymmetry of the lie bracket on and antisymmetry of the the jacobi identity follow from the correspond property of and of thus be a lie algebra put and it follow that also it follow with and that hence be a central extension of by it be call by a below follow some result regard central extension and theorem let and be cohomologous on a lie algebra and let and be respectively the central extension construct with these then the central extension and be equivalent extension proof by definition define it follow from the definition that be a lie algebra isomorphism and hold corollary a cohomology class define a central extension of which be unique up to isomorphism the trivial give the trivial extension and since a be cohomologous with the trivial one have corollary a central extension define by a coboundary be equivalent with a trivial central extension theorem a simple lie algebra have only trivial central extension proof since every central extension come from a it suffice to show that every be a coboundary suppose be a on the task be to use this to manufacture a such that the first step be to for each use to define a linear map but the linear map be element of this suffices to express in term of use the isomorphism next a linear map be define that turn out to be a derivation since all derivation be inner one have for some an expression for in term of and be obtain thus set trusting that be a derivation let be the define by then show that be a coboundary by the previous result any central extension be trivial to verify that actually be a derivation first note that it be linear since be then compute by appeal to the of the left argument of be equal on the far left and far right the observation that one can define a derivation give a symmetric associative form and a by or use the symmetry of and the antisymmetry of lead to a corollary corollary let be a symmetric associative bilinear form and let be a derivation satisfy then define by be a proof the condition on ensure the antisymmetry of the jacobi identity for follow start with use symmetry of the form the antisymmetry of the bracket and once again the definition of in term of if be the lie algebra of a lie group and be a central extension of one may ask whether there be a lie group with lie algebra the answer be by lie third theorem affirmative but be there a central extension of with lie algebra the answer to this question require some machinery and can be find in the negative result of the precede theorem indicate that one must at least for semisimple lie algebra go to lie algebra to find useful application of central extension there be indeed such here will be present affine algebra and virasoro algebra these be extension of polynomial and the witt algebra respectively let be a polynomial loop algebra background where be a complex simple lie algebra the goal be to find a central extension of this algebra two of the theorem apply on the one hand if there be a on then a central extension may be define on the other hand if this be act on the part only then the result extension be trivial moreover derivation act on only can not be use for definition of a either because these derivation be all inner and the same problem result one therefore look for derivation on one such set of derivation be in order to manufacture a bilinear associative antisymmetric form on attention be focus first on restriction on the argument with fixed it be a theorem that every form satisfy the requirement be a multiple of the kill form on this require symmetry of implies and associativity yield with one see that this last condition imply the former use this fact define the define equation then become for every the definition do define a symmetric associative bilinear form but these form the basis of a vector space in which every form have the right property return to the derivation at hand and the condition one see use the definition that or with this and the antisymmetry condition hold if in particular it hold when thus choose and with these choice the premise in the corollary be satisfy the define by be finally employ to define a central extension of with lie bracket for basis element suitably normalize and with antisymmetric structure constant one have this be a universal central extension of the polynomial loop algebra a note on terminology in physic terminology the algebra of above might pass for a algebra whilst it will probably not in mathematics terminology an additional dimension an extension by a derivation be require for this nonetheless if in a physical application the eigenvalue of or it representative be interpret a ordinary quantum number the additional superscript on the generator be refer to a the it be an additional quantum number an additional operator whose eigenvalue be precisely the level be introduce far below murray nobel laureate in physic initiate the field of current algebra in the it exploit know local symmetry even without knowledge of the underlie dynamic to extract prediction the sum rule a an application of a central extension of polynomial loop algebra a current algebra of a quantum field theory be consider background suppose one have a current algebra with the interesting commutator be with a schwinger term to construct this algebra mathematically let be the centrally extend polynomial loop algebra of the previous section with a one of the commutation relation or with a switch of notation with a factor of under the physic convention define use element of one note that so that it be define on a circle now compute the commutator for simplicity switch coordinate so that and use the commutation relation now employ the poisson summation formula for in the interval and differentiate it to yield and finally or since the delta function arguments only ensure that the argument of the left and right argument of the commutator be equal formally by comparison with this be a current algebra in two spacetime dimension include a schwinger term with the space dimension curl up into a circle in the classical setting of quantum field theory this be perhaps of little use but with the advent of string theory where field live on world sheet of string and spatial dimension be curl up there may be relevant application robert moody leave fellow of the royal society of canada be a canadian mathematician at university of alberta he be of the algebra together with victor kac fellow of the american mathematical society a russian mathematician work at mit the derivation use in the construction of the in the previous section can be extend to a derivation on the centrally extend polynomial loop algebra here denote by in order to realize a algebra background simply set next define a a vector space the lie bracket on be accord to the standard construction with a derivation give on a basis by for convenience define in addition assume the basis on the underlying simple lie algebra have be choose so that the structure coefficient be antisymmetric in all index and that the basis be appropriately normalized then one immediately through the definition verify the following commutation relation these be precisely the description of an untwisted affine algebra to recapitulate begin with a simple lie algebra define a space of formal laurent polynomial with coefficient in the simple lie algebra with the support of a symmetric alternate bilinear form and a derivation a be define subsequently use in the standard prescription for a central extension by a extend the derivation to this new space use the standard prescription for a split extension by a derivation and an untwisted affine algebra obtain the purpose be to construct the virasoro algebra due to miguel angel virasoro a a central extension by a of the witt algebra background the jacobi identity for yield let and use antisymmetry of one obtains in the extension the commutation relation for the element be it be desirable to get rid of the central charge on the right hand side to do this define then use a a so with this equivalent to the previous one one have with this new skip the prime the condition becomes and thus where the last condition be due to the antisymmetry of the lie bracket with this and with cut out a plane in yield that with cut out a line in becomes this be a difference equation generally solve by the commutator in the extension on element of be then with it be possible to change basis or modify the by a so that with the central charge absent altogether and the extension be hence trivial this be not generally the case with the previous modification where only obtain the original relation with the following change of basis the commutation relation take the form showing that the part linear in be trivial it also show that be correspond to the choice of the conventional choice be to take and still retain freedom by absorb an arbitrary factor in the arbitrary object the algebra be then with commutation relation open the relativistic classical open string background be subject to quantization this roughly amount to take the position and the momentum of the string and promote them to operator on the space of state of open string since string be extend object this result in a continuum of operator depend on the parameter the following commutation relation be postulate in the heisenberg picture all other commutator vanish because of the continuum of operator and because of the delta function it be desirable to express these relation instead in term of the quantized version of the virasoro modes the operator these be calculate to satisfy they be interpret a creation and annihilation operator act on hilbert space increase or decrease the quantum of their respective mode if the index be negative the operator be a creation operator otherwise it be an annihilation operator if it be zero it be proportional to the total momentum operator in view of the fact that the light cone plus and minus mode be express in term of the transverse virasoro modes one must consider the commutation relation between the virasoro operator these be classically define then modes a since in the quantized theory the alpha be operator the ordering of the factor matter in view of the commutation relation between the mode operator it will only matter for the operator for which be choose normal order where be a possible ordering constant one obtain after a somewhat lengthy calculation the relation if one would allow for above then one have precisely the commutation relation of the witt algebra instead one have upon identification of the generic central term a time the identity operator this be the virasoro algebra the universal central extension of the witt algebra the operator enter the theory a the hamiltonian modulo an additive constant moreover the virasoro operator enter into the definition of the lorentz generator of the theory it be perhaps the most important algebra in string theory the consistency of the lorentz generator by the way fix the spacetime dimensionality to while this theory present here for relative simplicity of exposition be unphysical or at the very least incomplete it have for instance no fermion the virasoro algebra arise in the same way in the more viable superstring theory and a projective representation of a lie group background can be use to define a group extension in quantum mechanic wigner theorem asserts that if be a symmetry group then it will be represent projectively on hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operator this be often dealt with by pass to the universal cover group of and take it a the symmetry group this work nicely for the rotation group and the lorentz group but it do not work when the symmetry group be the galilean group in this case one have to pass to it central extension the group which be the symmetry group of the schrödinger equation likewise if the group of translation in position and momentum space one have to pass to it central extension the heisenberg group let be the on induce by define a a set and let the multiplication be define by associativity hold since be a on one have for the unit element and for the inverse the set be an abelian subgroup of this mean that be not semisimple the center of include this subgroup the center may be large at the level of lie algebra it can be show that the lie algebra of be give by a a vector space and endow with the lie bracket here be a on this can be obtain from albeit in a highly nontrivial way now by use the projective representation one may define a map by it have the property so be a bona fide representation of in the context of wigner theorem the situation may be depict a such replace by let denote the unit sphere in hilbert space and let be it inner product let denote ray space and the ray product let moreover a wiggly arrow denote a group action then the diagram center commute moreover in the same way that be a symmetry of preserving be a symmetry of preserve the fiber of be all circle these circle be leave invariant under the action of the action of on these fiber be transitive with no fixed point the conclusion be that be a principal fiber bundle over with structure group in order to adequately discuss extension structure that go beyond the define property of a lie algebra be need rudimentary fact about these be collect here for quick reference a on a lie algebra be a map such that the leibniz rule hold the set of derivation on a lie algebra be denote it be itself a lie algebra under the lie bracket it be the lie algebra of the group of automorphisms of one have to show if the rh hold differentiate and set implying that the lh hold if the lh hold write the rh a and differentiate the rh of this expression it be use identically zero hence the rh of this expression be independent of and equal it value for which be the lh of this expression if then act by be a derivation the set be the set of derivation on for simple lie algebra all derivation be inner derivation product group consider two lie group and and the automorphism group of the latter be the group of isomorphism of if there be a lie group homomorphism then for each there be a with the property denote with the set and define multiplication by then be a group with identity and the inverse be give by use the expression for the inverse and equation it be see that be normal in denote the group with this semidirect product a conversely if be a give semidirect product expression of the group then by definition be normal in and for each where and the map be a homomorphism now make use of the lie correspondence the map each induce at the level of lie algebras a map this map be compute by for instance if and be both subgroup of a large group and then and one recognizes a the adjoint action of on restrict to now if be be a homomorphism and appeal once more to the lie correspondence there be a unique lie algebra homomorphism this map be formally give by for example if then formally where a relationship between and the adjoint action rigorously prove in here be use lie algebra the lie algebra be a a vector space this be clear since generates and the lie bracket be give by to compute the

main article let be a hamel basis for then each have a unique expression a for some indexing set of suitable size in this expansion only finitely many be nonzero in the sequel it be for simplicity assume that the basis be countable and latin letter be use for the index and the indexing set can be take to be one immediately have for the basis elements where the summation symbol have be rationalize away the summation convention apply the placement of the index in the structure constants up or down be immaterial the following theorem be useful theorem there be a basis such that the structure constant be antisymmetric in all index if and only if the lie algebra be a direct sum of simple compact lie algebra and lie algebra this be the case if and only if there be a real positive definite metric on satisfy the invariance condition in any basis this last condition be necessary on physical ground for gauge theory in quantum field theory thus one can produce an infinite list of possible gauge theory use the cartan catalog of simple lie algebra on their compact form etc one such gauge theory be the gauge theory of the standard model with lie algebra the form be a symmetric bilinear form on define by here be view a a matrix operate on the vector space the key fact need be that if be semisimple then by cartan criterion be in such a case may be use to identify and if then there be a such that this be resemble riesz representation theorem and the proof be virtually the same the kill form have the property which be refer to a associativity by define and expand the inner bracket in term of structure constant one find that the kill form satisfy the invariance condition of above a loop group be take a a group of smooth map from the unit circle into a lie group with the group structure define by the group structure on the lie algebra of a loop group be then a vector space of mapping from into the lie algebra of any subalgebra of such a lie algebra be refer to a a algebra attention here be focus on loop algebra of the form to see this consider elements near the identity in for in the loop group express in a basis for where the be real and small and the implicit

convention applies and the be by the definition bury in the s in the right hand side algebra physic current algebra arise in quantum field theory a a consequence of global gauge symmetry conserve current occur in classical field theory whenever the lagrangian respect a continuous symmetry this be the content of noether theorem most perhaps all modern quantum field theory can be formulate in tern of classical lagrangians prior to quantization so noether theorem applies in the quantum case as well upon quantization the conserved current be promote to position dependent operator on hilbert space these operator be subject to commutation relation generally form an lie algebra a model illustrate this be present below to enhance the flavor of physic factor of will appear here and there as oppose to in the mathematical convention consider a column vector of scalar field let the lagrangian density be this lagrangian be invariant under the transformation where be generator of either or a closed subgroup thereof satisfy noether theorem assert the existence of conserved current where be the momentum canonically conjugate to the reason these current be say to be conserve be because and consequently the associate to the density be constant in time this so far classical theory be quantize promote the field and their conjugate to operator on hilbert space and by postulate bosonic quantization the commutation relation the current accordingly become operator they satisfy use the above postulate relation the definition and integration over space the commutation relation where the speed of light and the reduced planck constant have be set to unity the last commutation relation do not follow from the postulated commutation relation these be fix only for not for except for for the lorentz transformation behavior be use to deduce the conclusion the next commutator to consider be the presence of the delta function and their derivative be explain by the requirement of that imply that the commutator vanishes when thus the commutator must be a distribution support at the first term be fix due to the requirement that the equation should when integrate over reduce to the last equation before it the following term be the term they integrate to zero but it can be show quite generally that they must be nonzero consider a conserved current with a generic schwinger term by take the vacuum expectation value vev one find where and heisenberg equation of motion have be use as well a and it conjugate multiply this equation by and integrate with respect to and over all space

considerably with a clever choice of parametrization call the light cone gauge in this gauge the equation of motion become the ordinary wave equation the price to be pay be that the light cone gauge impose constraint so that one can not simply take arbitrary solution of the wave equation to represent the string the string consider here be open string they do close up on themselves this mean that

isosurface of static electron density for doxycycline result from the multipole model refinement at level equivalent isosurface result from the independent atom model notice the lack of covalent bond electrons the density formalism also refer to a formalism be an crystallography method of electron density model propose by niels hansen and philip coppens in unlike the commonly used independent atom model the formalism present an aspherical approach allow one to model the electron distribution around a nucleus separately in different direction and therefore describe numerous chemical feature of a molecule inside the unit cell of an examined crystal in detail visual representation of a few real spherical harmonic use in multipole density formalism the distance of the surface from the origin be proportional to the value for give angle while the color denote the sign blue for positive yellow for negative independent atom model the independent atom model abbreviate to iam upon which the multipole model be base be a method of charge density model it rely on an assumption that electron distribution around the atom be isotropic and that therefore charge density be dependent only on the distance from a nucleus the choice of the radial function use to describe this electron density be arbitrary grant that it value at the origin be finite in practice either or function be use due to it simplistic approach this method provide a straightforward model that require no additional parameter other than positional and factor to be refine this allow the iam to perform satisfactorily while a relatively low amount of data from the diffraction experiment be available however the fixed shape of the singular basis function prevent any detailed description of aspherical atomic feature kappa formalism in order to adjust some valence shell parameters the kappa formalism be propose it introduce two additional refineable parameter an outer shell population denote a and it therefore the electron density be formulate a while be responsible for the charge flow part be linearly couple with partial charge the normalised parameter scale radial coordinate therefore lower the parameter result in expansion of the outer shell and conversely raise it result in contraction although the kappa formalism be still strictly speak a spherical method it be an important step towards understand modern approach a it allow one to distinguish chemically different atom of the same element multipole description in the multipole model description the charge density around a nucleus be give by the following equation the spherical part remain almost indistinguishable from the kappa formalism the only difference be one parameter correspond to the population of the inner shell the real strength of the formalism lie in the right deformational part of the equation here fulfil a role similar to in the kappa formalism of the aspherical part whereas individual be fix spherical function analogous to spherical harmonic each with it populational parameter be however introduce to simulate the electrically anisotropic charge distribution in this approach a fix coordinate system for each atom need to be apply although at first glance it seem practical to arbitrarily and indiscriminately make it contingent on the unit cell for all atom present it be far more beneficial to assign each atom it own local coordinate which allow for focus on interaction while the singular sigma bond of the hydrogen can be describe well use certain pseudoorbitals orient multipoles with a rotational symmetry will prove more beneficial for flat aromatic structure electron density isosurface map around a covalent bond model with the multipole model with populational parameter take from the database note the elongated area next to the hydrogen atom point in the direction of oxygen electron density isosurface map around a covalent bond model with the independent atom model in the same scale function impose low charge density on the bond path the primary advantage of the formalism be it ability to free the model from spherical restraint and describe the surroundings of a nucleus far more accurately in this way it become possible to examine some molecular feature which would normally be only roughly approximate or completely ignore crystallography allow the researcher to precisely determine the position of peak electron density and to reason about the placement of nucleus base on this information this approach work without any problem for heavy atom whose inner shell electron contribute to the density function to a far great degree then outer shell electron however hydrogen atom possess a feature unique among all the element they possess exactly one electron which additionally be locate on their valence shell and therefore be involve in create strong covalent bond with atom of various other element while a bond be form the maximum of the electron density function move significantly away from the nucleus and towards the other atom this prevent any spherical approach from determine hydrogen position correctly by itself therefore usually the hydrogen position be estimate base on neutron crystallography data for similar molecule or it be not model at all in the case of diffraction data it be possible albeit disputable to freely refine hydrogen atom position use the formalism after release the bond length from any restraint derive from neutron measurement the bonding orbital simulate with adequate multipoles describe the density distribution neatly while preserve believable bond length it may be worth approximate hydrogen atom anisotropic displacement parameter use shade before introduce the formalism and possibly discard bond distance constraint in order to analyse the length and strength of various interaction within the molecule richard bader atom in molecule theorem may be apply due to the complex description of the electron field provide by this aspherical model it become possible to establish realistic bond path between interact atom as well a to find and characterise their critical point deep insight into this data yield useful information about bond strength type polarity or ellipticity and when compare with other molecule brings great understand about the actual electron structure of the examine compound due to the fact that for each multipole of every atom it population be be refine independently individual charge will rarely be integer in real case electron density flow freely through the molecule and be not bind by any restriction result from the outdated bohr atom model and find in iam therefore through an accurate bader analysis net atomic charge may be estimate which again be beneficial for deepen the understanding of system under investigation although the multipole formalism be a simple and straightforward alternative mean of structure refinement it be definitely not flawless while usually for each atom either three or nine parameter be to be refine depend on whether an anisotropic displacement be be take into account or not a full multipole description of heavy atom belong to the fourth and subsequent period such a chlorine iron or bromine require refinement of up to parameter this prove problematic for any crystal possess large asymmetric unit especially macromolecular compound and render a refinement use the formalism unachievable for data with an unsatisfactory ratio of independent reflection to refine parameter caution should be take while refine some of the parameter simultaneously or multipole population and thermal parameter a they may correlate strongly result in an unstable refinement or unphysical parameter value apply additional constraint result from local symmetry for each atom in a molecule which decrease the number of refined multipoles or import populational parameter from exist database may also be necessary to achieve a passable model on the other hand the aforementioned approach significantly reduce the amount of information require from experiment while preserve some level of detail concern aspherical charge distribution therefore even macromolecular structure with satisfactory diffraction data can be model aspherically in a similar fashion despite their similarity individual multipoles do not correspond to any particular molecular orbitals result from quantum calculation a their sole aim be to estimate the charge density distribution not a molecule electron structure in order to find some relationship between the experiment and quantum wave function the hirshfeld atom refinement may be apply or other method of the quantum crystallography,Multipole density formalism,Branches of biology,Biophysics
time translation symmetry or translation symmetry be a mathematical transformation in physic that move the time of event through a common interval time translation symmetry be the hypothesis that the law of physic be unchanged invariant under such a transformation time translation symmetry be a rigorous way to formulate the idea that the law of physic be the same throughout history time translation symmetry be closely connect via the noether theorem to conservation of energy in mathematics the set of all time translation on a give system form a lie group there be many symmetry in nature besides time translation such a spatial translation or rotational symmetry these symmetry can be break and explain diverse phenomenon such a crystal superconductivity and the higgs mechanism however it be think until very recently that time translation symmetry could not be broken time crystal a state of matter first observe in break time translation symmetry symmetry be of prime importance in physic and be closely relate to the hypothesis that certain physical quantity be only relative and unobservable symmetry apply to the equation that govern the physical law to a hamiltonian or lagrangian rather than the initial condition value or magnitude of the equation themselves and state that the law remain unchanged under a transformation if a symmetry be preserve under a transformation it be say to be invariant symmetry in nature lead directly to conservation law something which be precisely formulate by the noether theorem symmetry in physic symmetry transformation unobservable conservation law absolute position in space momentum absolute time energy rotation absolute direction in space angular momentum space inversion absolute leave or right parity absolute sign of time kramers degeneracy sign reversion of charge absolute sign of electric charge charge conjugation particle substitution distinguishability of identical particle bose or fermi statistic gauge transformation relative phase between different normal state particle number to formally describe time translation symmetry we say the equation or law that describe a system at time and be the same for any value of and for example consider newton equation one find for it solution the combination do not depend on the variable of course this quantity describe the total energy whose conservation be due to the time translation invariance of the equation of motion by study the composition of symmetry transformation of geometric object one reach the conclusion that they form a group and more specifically a lie transformation group if one consider continuous finite symmetry transformation different symmetry form different group with different geometry time independent hamiltonian system form a group of time translation that be describe by the abelian lie group tt be therefore a dynamical or hamiltonian dependent symmetry rather than a kinematical symmetry which would be the same for the entire set of hamiltonians at issue other example can be see in the study of time evolution equation of classical and quantum physic many differential equation describe time evolution equation be expression of invariant associate to some lie group and the theory of these group provide a unifying viewpoint for the study of all special function and all their property in fact sophus lie invent the theory of lie group when study the symmetry of differential equation the integration of a partial differential equation by the method of separation of variable or by lie algebraic method be intimately connect with the existence of symmetry for example the exact solubility of the schrödinger equation in quantum mechanic can be trace back to the underlying invariance in the latter case the investigation of symmetry allows for an interpretation of the degeneracy where different configuration to have the same energy which generally occur in the energy spectrum of quantum system continuous symmetry in physic be often formulate in term of infinitesimal rather than finite transformation one consider the lie algebra rather than the lie group of transformation the invariance of a hamiltonian of an isolated system under time translation imply it energy do not change with the passage of time conservation of energy implies accord to the heisenberg equation of motion that or where be the time translation operator which imply invariance of the hamiltonian under the time translation operation and lead to the conservation of energy in many nonlinear field theory like general relativity or theories the basic field equation be highly nonlinear and exact solution be only know for distribution of matter rotationally or axially symmetric configuration time translation symmetry be guarantee only in spacetimes where the metric be static that be where there be a coordinate system in which the metric coefficient contain no time variable many general relativity system be not static in any frame of reference so no conserved energy can be define time crystal a state of matter first observe in break time translation symmetry absolute time and space
