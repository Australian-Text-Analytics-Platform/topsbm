 solving gauge invariant systems without gauge fixing the physical projector in 0 1 dimensional theories the projector onto gauge invariant physical states was recently constructed for arbitrary constrained systems this approach which does not require gauge fixing nor any additional degrees of freedom beyond the original ones  two characteristic features of all other available methods for quantising constrained dynamics  is put to work in the context of a general class of quantum mechanical gauge invariant systems the cases of so 2 and so 3 gauge groups are considered specifically and a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding physical spectra is achieved in a straightforward manner using only standard methods of coherent states and group theory which are directly amenable to generalisation to other lie algebras results extend by far the few examples available in the literature from much more subtle and delicate analyses implying gauge fixing and the characterization of modular space , solving gauge invariant systems without gauge fixing the physical projector in 0 1 dimensional theories,Mathematical Physics

 tree structures entropy and action principles for neighbourhood topologies  we recast the idea of decision trees as they emerge in information theory and complexity theory into a set theoretical language the result we call tree structures over a given set we identify all main structural elements of tree structures the most important of which is the tree function defined as a sum over certain quantities at every nod in the tree we show in detail that the minimization of the tree function on possibly constrained sets of tree structures renders the functional form of entropy or of wiener shannon information depending on the context we suggest three natural axioms defining tree structures which are valid also when the underlying set is infinite in this case the resulting trees are fractal like objects these axioms turn out to be related to the neighbourhood axioms describing neighbourhoods on a topological space in fact we will show that the paths in a tree structure  which are totally ordered subsets of a tree can be regarded as a countable neighbourhood basis which in turn defines a topology on the underlying set  the tree function then assigns nonnegative numbers to every neighbourhood topology on the underlying set that arises from a tree structure on the preferred topology this number becomes minimal in which case it represents an entropy like quantity this has the distinct flavour of an action principle  distinguishing certain topologies by means of minimization of the tree function this result hints at a deep relation between entropy like quantities and preferred neighbourhood topologies on sets , tree structures entropy and action principles for neighbourhood topologies ,"Mathematical Physics, General"

 equivalence principle tunnelling quantized spectra and trajectories from the quantum hj equation  a basic aspect of the recently proposed approach to quantum mechanics is that no use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave function is made in particular the quantum potential turns out to be an intrinsic potential energy of the particle which similarly to the relativistic rest energy is never vanishing this is related to the tunnel effect a consequence of the fact that the conjugate momentum field is real even in the classically forbidden regions  the quantum stationary hamilton jacobi equation is defined only if the ratio psi d psi of two real linearly independent solutions of the schroedinger equation and therefore of the trivializing map is a local homeomorphism of the extended real line into itself a consequence of the moebius symmetry of the schwarzian derivative in this respect we prove a basic theorem relating the request of continuity at spatial infinity of psi d psi a consequence of the q  1 q duality of the schwarzian derivative to the existence of l 2 r  solutions of the corresponding schroedinger equation as a result while in the conventional approach one needs the schroedinger equation with the l 2 r  condition consequence of the axiomatic interpretation of the wave function  the equivalence principle by itself implies a dynamical equation that does not need any assumption and reproduces both the tunnel effect and energy quantization , equivalence principle tunnelling quantized spectra and trajectories from the quantum hj equation ,"Mathematical Physics, Exactly"

 on the only three short distance structures which can be described by linear operators  we point out that if spatial information is encoded through linear operators  x i  or infinite dimensional matrices with an involution x i  x i then these x i can only describe either continuous discrete or certain  fuzzy  space time structures we argue that the fuzzy space structure may be relevant at the planck scale the possibility of this fuzzy space time structure is related to subtle features of infinite dimensional matrices which do not have an analogue in finite dimensions for example there is a slightly weaker version of self adjointness symmetry and there is a slightly weaker version of unitarity isometry related to this we also speculate that the presence of horizons may lead to merely isometric rather than unitary time evolution , on the only three short distance structures which can be described by linear operators ,"Quantum Algebra, Mathematical Physics"
 semigroup extensions of isometry groups of flat spacetimes compactified over lightlike lattices we examine some peculiarities of the subset of lattice preserving elements in a pseudo euclidean group when the lattice under consideration contains a lightlike vector or more generally when the restriction of a pseudo euclidean metric to the real linear enveloppe of the lattice is not definite for the case of a lorentzian metric it is shown in detail that the isometry group of the spacetime compactified over such a lattice admits a natural extension to a semigroup we explain why such an extension is not available for spacelike lattices furthermore we argue that for any lagrangian defined on such a lightlike compactified spacetime the elements of the semigroup relate sectors of the theory belonging to different discrete compactification radii and hence connect different superselection sectors of the theory this mapping occurs as a one way process owing to the non invertibility of the semigroup elements on the lattice these structures might therefore be of relevance to matrix theory , semigroup extensions of isometry groups of flat spacetimes compactified over lightlike lattices,Mathematical Physics

 interferometric evidence for brane world cosmologies the hypothesis of brane embedded matter appears to gain increasing credibility in astrophysics however it can only be truly successful if its implications on particle interaction are consistent with existing knowledge  this letter focuses on the issue of optical interference and shows that at least one brane world model can offer plausible interpretations for both young s double slit experiment and the experiments that fit less neatly with it the basic assumption is that particles can interact at a distance through the vibrations induced by their motion on the brane the qualitative analysis of this mechanism suggests that fringe visibility in single photon interference depends on the energy levels and the interval between interacting particles a double slit experiment performed with coherent single red photons should reveal the disappearance of interference when the time delay between individual particles is increased over 2 18 seconds in the case of infrared photons with the frequency of 9 cdot 10 13  hz interference must vanish already at the interval of one second , interferometric evidence for brane world cosmologies,Optics

 the character of the exceptional series of representations of su 1 1  the character of the exceptional series of representations of su 1 1 is determined by using bargmann s realization of the representation in the hilbert space h sigma of functions defined on the unit circle the construction of the integral kernel of the group ring turns out to be especially involved because of the non local metric appearing in the scalar product with respect to which the representations are unitary since the non local metric disappears in the momentum space  i e  in the space of the fourier coefficients the integral kernel is constructed in the momentum space which is transformed back to yield the integral kernel of the group ring in h sigma  the rest of the procedure is parallel to that for the principal series treated in a previous paper the main advantage of this method is that the entire analysis can be carried out within the canonical framework of bargmann , the character of the exceptional series of representations of su 1 1 ,Mathematical Physics
 casimir effect the classical limit we analyze the high temperature or classical limit of the casimir effect a useful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the  relative casimir energy  which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting boundaries of arbitrary shapes as the difference of casimir energies between the given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely far apart using path integration techniques we show that the relative casimir energy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature this is consistent with a simple physical argument based on kirchhoff s law as a result the  relative casimir entropy  which we define in an obviously analogous manner tends in the classical limit to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the geometry of the boundaries thus the casimir force between disjoint pieces of the boundary in the classical limit is entropy driven and is governed by a dimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity contributions to the casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected component of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from the behavior just described these logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to our difficulty to separate the casimir energy and the other thermodynamical quantities from the  electromagnetic  self energy of each of the connected components of the boundary in a well defined manner our approach to the casimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating field but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of  charge carriers  in the boundary with the plasma frequency playing the role of a physical uv cutoff this also allows us to analyze deviations from a perfect conductor behavior , casimir effect the classical limit,Statistical Mechanics
