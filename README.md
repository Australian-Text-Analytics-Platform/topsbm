# ATAP: TopSBM

TopSBM is a topic modelling approach that infers a hierarchy of topic clusters and word clusters in your Corpus
in a non-parametric manner by leveraging stochastic block models.

Top (Topic), SBM (Stochastic Block Models).

This repository is an integration effort of TopSBM to the ATAP platform.

## Demo
This is demo jupyter notebook for TopSBM with ATAP Corpus integration. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to download 
a Corpus with TopSBM results. You may then choose to upload this Corpus across to other ATAP tools for further analysis.
