# ATAP: Topsbm

TopSBM is a topic modelling approach that infers a hierarchy of topic clusters and word clusters in your Corpus
in a non-parametric manner by leveraging stochastic block models.

Top (Topic), SBM (Stochastic Block Models).

This repository is an integration effort of TopSBM to the ATAP platform.

The original TopSBM repository can be found here: https://github.com/martingerlach/hSBM_Topicmodel
